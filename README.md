# An Introduction to Elm

This is my book about Elm. You can read it online [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org)!

I update it like a paper book, with a new edition periodically rather than lots of small changes. Maybe it will be a paper book someday, but I plan to retain ownership of the material such that the complete book is always available for free online.

## About Suggestions

There are many ways to improve this book. Many of them require structural changes that would present concepts in a better order. Changes like this are quite difficult, especially in a collaborative way. I want the book to come out coherent more than I want it to address every possible concern.

So the kind of PRs that are practical to handle include:

- Fixing misspellings
- Fixing broken links
- Fixing typos in code

Make a PR as small as possible. Reviewing a typo is easy. Reviewing 10 typos is hard because 9 may be good. Now there is a bigger coordination overhead.

If you are confused about something, make an issue that explains:

- Your programming background
- How you found the guide
- Why you want to learn this language
- The thing you found confusing

The answers do not have to be super elaborate. I just need to understand who is confused and why. As I learn more about the readers, it is possible to revamp the book that addresses their concerns in a coherent way. Ultimately I must pick an audience, so it fundamentally cannot work for everyone. Choices must be made!
