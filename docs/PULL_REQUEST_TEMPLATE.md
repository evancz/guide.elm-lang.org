There are many ways to improve this book. Many of them require structural changes that would present concepts in a better order. These are quite hard to do, especially in a collaborative way if you want the book to come out coherent.

So the kind of PRs that are practical to handle include:

  - [ ] Fixing misspellings
  - [ ] Fixing broken links
  - [ ] Fixing code that is off for some reason, like a missing import or typo

More extreme cases are best reported and organized in a coherent way. From there, it is possible to do a revamp of the book that addresses readers concerns in a coherent way. Ultimately you also have to pick an audience, so it fundamentally cannot work for everyone. By logging who is confused and why, you can do better though!
