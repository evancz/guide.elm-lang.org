Introduction to Elm\nElm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.\nThis guide will:\n\nTeach you the fundamentals of programming in Elm.\nShow you how to make interactive apps with The Elm Architecture.\nEmphasize the principles and patterns that generalize to programming in any language.\n\nBy the end I hope you will not only be able to create great web apps in Elm, but also understand the core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.\nIf you are on the fence, I can safely guarantee that if you give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will end up writing better JavaScript and React code. The ideas transfer pretty easily!\nA Quick Sample\nOf course I think Elm is good, so look for yourself.\nHere is a simple counter. If you look at the code, it just lets you increment and decrement the counter:\nimport Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)\nimport Html.Events exposing (onClick)\n\nmain =\n  Html.beginnerProgram { model = 0, view = view, update = update }\n\ntype Msg = Increment | Decrement\n\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Increment ->\n      model + 1\n\n    Decrement ->\n      model - 1\n\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text \"-\" ]\n    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]\n    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text \"+\" ]\n    ]\n\nNotice that the update and view are entirely decoupled. You describe your HTML in a declarative way and Elm takes care of messing with the DOM.\nWhy a functional language?\nForget what you have heard about functional programming. Fancy words, weird ideas, bad tooling. Barf. Elm is about:\n\nNo runtime errors in practice. No null. No undefined is not a function.\nFriendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.\nWell-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.\nAutomatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.\n\nNo combination of JS libraries can ever give you this, yet it is all free and easy in Elm. Now these nice things are only possible because Elm builds upon 40+ years of work on typed functional languages. So Elm is a functional language because the practical benefits are worth the couple hours you'll spend reading this guide.\nI have put a huge emphasis on making Elm easy to learn and use, so all I ask is that you give Elm a shot and see what you think. I hope you will be pleasantly surprised!\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"\nNote: If you do not want to install yet, you can follow along in this guide with the online editor and the online REPL.\n\nInstall\n\nMac — installer\nWindows — installer\nAnywhere — npm installer or build from source\n\nAfter installing through any of those routes, you will have the following command line tools:\n\nelm-repl — play with Elm expressions\nelm-reactor — get a project going quickly\nelm-make — compile Elm code directly\nelm-package — download packages\n\nWe will go over how they all work in more detail right after we get your editor set up!\n\nTroubleshooting: The fastest way to learn anything is to talk with other people in the Elm community. We are friendly and happy to help! So if you get stuck during installation or encounter something weird, visit the Elm Slack and ask about it. In fact, if you run into something confusing at any point while learning or using Elm, come ask us about it. You can save yourself hours. Just do it!\n\nConfigure Your Editor\nUsing Elm is way nicer when you have a code editor to help you out. There are Elm plugins for at least the following editors:\n\nAtom\nBrackets\nEmacs\nIntelliJ\nLight Table\nSublime Text\nVim\nVS Code\n\nIf you do not have an editor at all, Sublime Text is a great one to get started with!\nYou may also want to try out elm-format which makes your code pretty!\nThe Command Line Tools\nSo we installed Elm, and it gave us elm-repl, elm-reactor, elm-make, and elm-package. But what do they all do exactly?\nelm-repl\nelm-repl lets you play with simple Elm expressions.\n$ elm-repl\n---- elm-repl 0.18.0 -----------------------------------------------------------\n :help for help, :exit to exit, more at \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> 1 / 2\n0.5 : Float\n> List.length [1,2,3,4]\n4 : Int\n> String.reverse \"stressed\"\n\"desserts\" : String\n> :exit\n$\n\nWe will be using elm-repl in the upcoming “Core Language” section, and you can read more about how it works here.\n\nNote: elm-repl works by compiling code to JavaScript, so make sure you have Node.js installed. We use that to evaluate code.\n\nelm-reactor\nelm-reactor helps you build Elm projects without messing with the command-line too much. You just run it at the root of your project, like this:\ngit clone https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial.git\ncd elm-architecture-tutorial\nelm-reactor\n\nThis starts a server at http://localhost:8000. You can navigate to any Elm file and see what it looks like. Try to check out examples/01-button.elm.\nNotable flags:\n\n--port lets you pick something besides port 8000. So you can say\nelm-reactor --port=8123 to get things to run at http://localhost:8123.\n--address lets you replace localhost with some other address. For\nexample, you may want to use elm-reactor --address=0.0.0.0 if you want to\ntry out an Elm program on a mobile device through your local network.\n\nelm-make\nelm-make builds Elm projects. It can compile Elm code to HTML or JavaScript. It is the most general way to compile Elm code, so if your project becomes too advanced for elm-reactor, you will want to start using elm-make directly.\nSay you want to compile Main.elm to an HTML file named main.html. You would run this command:\nelm-make Main.elm --output=main.html\n\nNotable flags:\n\n--warn prints warnings to improve code quality\n\nelm-package\nelm-package downloads and publishes packages from our package catalog. As community members solve problems in a nice way, they share their code in the package catalog for anyone to use!\nSay you want to use elm-lang/http and NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline to make HTTP requests to a server and turn the resulting JSON into Elm values. You would say:\nelm-package install elm-lang/http\nelm-package install NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline\n\nThis will add the dependencies to your elm-package.json file that describes your project. (Or create it if you do not have one yet!) More information about all this here!\nNotable commands:\n\ninstall: install the dependencies in elm-package.json\npublish: publish your library to the Elm Package Catalog\nbump: bump version numbers based on API changes\ndiff: get the difference between two APIs\n\n"},"core_language.html":{"url":"core_language.html","title":"Core Language","keywords":"","body":"Core Language\nThis section will walk you through Elm's simple core language.\nThis works best when you follow along, so after installing, start up elm-repl in the terminal. (Or use the online REPL.) Either way, you should see something like this:\n---- elm repl 0.18.0 -----------------------------------------------------------\n :help for help, :exit to exit, more at \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n\nThe REPL prints out the type of every result, but we will leave the type annotations off in this tutorial for the sake of introducing concepts gradually.\nWe will cover values, functions, lists, tuples, and records. These building blocks all correspond pretty closely with structures in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java.\nValues\nLet's get started with some strings:\n> \"hello\"\n\"hello\"\n\n> \"hello\" ++ \"world\"\n\"helloworld\"\n\n> \"hello\" ++ \" world\"\n\"hello world\"\n\nElm uses the (++) operator to put strings together. Notice that both strings are preserved exactly as is when they are put together so when we combine \"hello\" and \"world\" the result has no spaces.\nMath looks normal too:\n> 2 + 3 * 4\n14\n\n> (2 + 3) * 4\n20\n\nUnlike JavaScript, Elm makes a distinction between integers and floating point numbers. Just like Python 3, there is both floating point division (/) and integer division (//).\n> 9 / 2\n4.5\n\n> 9 // 2\n4\n\nFunctions\nLet's start by writing a function isNegative that takes in some number and checks if it is less than zero. The result will be True or False.\n> isNegative n = n \n\n> isNegative 4\nFalse\n\n> isNegative -7\nTrue\n\n> isNegative (-3 * -4)\nFalse\n\nNotice that function application looks different than in languages like JavaScript and Python and Java. Instead of wrapping all arguments in parentheses and separating them with commas, we use spaces to apply the function. So (add(3,4)) becomes (add 3 4) which ends up avoiding a bunch of parens and commas as things get bigger. Ultimately, this looks much cleaner once you get used to it! The elm-html package is a good example of how this keeps things feeling light.\nIf Expressions\nWhen you want to have conditional behavior in Elm, you use an if-expression.\n> if True then \"hello\" else \"world\"\n\"hello\"\n\n> if False then \"hello\" else \"world\"\n\"world\"\n\nThe keywords if then else are used to separate the conditional and the two branches so we do not need any parentheses or curly braces.\nElm does not have a notion of “truthiness” so numbers and strings and lists cannot be used as boolean values. If we try it out, Elm will tell us that we need to work with a real boolean value.\nNow let's make a function that tells us if a number is over 9000.\n> over9000 powerLevel = \\\n|   if powerLevel > 9000 then \"It's over 9000!!!\" else \"meh\"\n\n\n> over9000 42\n\"meh\"\n\n> over9000 100000\n\"It's over 9000!!!\"\n\nUsing a backslash in the REPL lets us split things on to multiple lines. We use this in the definition of over9000 above. Furthermore, it is best practice to always bring the body of a function down a line. It makes things a lot more uniform and easy to read, so you want to do this with all the functions and values you define in normal code.\n\nNote: Make sure that you add a whitespace before the second line of the function. Elm has a \"syntactically significant whitespace\" meaning that indentation is a part of its syntax.\n\nLists\nLists are one of the most common data structures in Elm. They hold a sequence of related things, similar to arrays in JavaScript.\nLists can hold many values. Those values must all have the same type. Here are a few examples that use functions from the List library:\n> names = [ \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Chuck\" ]\n[\"Alice\",\"Bob\",\"Chuck\"]\n\n> List.isEmpty names\nFalse\n\n> List.length names\n3\n\n> List.reverse names\n[\"Chuck\",\"Bob\",\"Alice\"]\n\n> numbers = [1,4,3,2]\n[1,4,3,2]\n\n> List.sort numbers\n[1,2,3,4]\n\n> double n = n * 2\n\n\n> List.map double numbers\n[2,8,6,4]\n\nAgain, all elements of the list must have the same type.\nTuples\nTuples are another useful data structure. A tuple can hold a fixed number of values, and each value can have any type. A common use is if you need to return more than one value from a function. The following function gets a name and gives a message for the user:\n> import String\n\n> goodName name = \\\n|   if String.length name  goodName \"Tom\"\n(True, \"name accepted!\")\n\nThis can be quite handy, but when things start becoming more complicated, it is often best to use records instead of tuples.\nRecords\nA record is a set of key-value pairs, similar to objects in JavaScript or Python. You will find that they are extremely common and useful in Elm! Let's see some basic examples.\n> point = { x = 3, y = 4 }\n{ x = 3, y = 4 }\n\n> point.x\n3\n\n> bill = { name = \"Gates\", age = 57 }\n{ age = 57, name = \"Gates\" }\n\n> bill.name\n\"Gates\"\n\nSo we can create records using curly braces and access fields using a dot. Elm also has a version of record access that works like a function. By starting the variable with a dot, you are saying please access the field with the following name. This means that .name is a function that gets the name field of the record.\n> .name bill\n\"Gates\"\n\n> List.map .name [bill,bill,bill]\n[\"Gates\",\"Gates\",\"Gates\"]\n\nWhen it comes to making functions with records, you can do some pattern matching to make things a bit lighter.\n> under70 {age} = age \n\n> under70 bill\nTrue\n\n> under70 { species = \"Triceratops\", age = 68000000 }\nFalse\n\nSo we can pass any record in as long as it has an age field that holds a number.\nIt is often useful to update the values in a record.\n> { bill | name = \"Nye\" }\n{ age = 57, name = \"Nye\" }\n\n> { bill | age = 22 }\n{ age = 22, name = \"Gates\" }\n\nIt is important to notice that we do not make destructive updates. When we update some fields of bill we actually create a new record rather than overwriting the existing one. Elm makes this efficient by sharing as much content as possible. If you update one of ten fields, the new record will share the nine unchanged values.\nComparing Records and Objects\nRecords in Elm are similar to objects in JavaScript, but there are some crucial differences. The major differences are that with records:\n\nYou cannot ask for a field that does not exist.\nNo field will ever be undefined or null.\nYou cannot create recursive records with a this or self keyword.\n\nElm encourages a strict separation of data and logic, and the ability to say this is primarily used to break this separation. This is a systemic problem in Object Oriented languages that Elm is purposely avoiding.\nRecords also support structural typing which means records in Elm can be used in any situation as long as the necessary fields exist. This gives us flexibility without compromising reliability.\n"},"architecture/":{"url":"architecture/","title":"The Elm Architecture","keywords":"","body":"The Elm Architecture\nThe Elm Architecture is a simple pattern for architecting webapps. It is great for modularity, code reuse, and testing. Ultimately, it makes it easy to create complex web apps that stay healthy as you refactor and add features.\nThis architecture seems to emerge naturally in Elm. We first observed it in the games the Elm community was making. Then in web apps like TodoMVC and dreamwriter too. Now we see it running in production at companies like NoRedInk and Pivotal. The architecture seems to be a consequence of the design of Elm itself, so it will happen to you whether you know about it or not. This has proven to be really nice for onboarding new developers. Their code just turns out well-architected. It is kind of spooky.\nSo The Elm Architecture is easy in Elm, but it is useful in any front-end project. In fact, projects like Redux have been inspired by The Elm Architecture, so you may have already seen derivatives of this pattern. Point is, even if you ultimately cannot use Elm at work yet, you will get a lot out of using Elm and internalizing this pattern.\nThe Basic Pattern\nThe logic of every Elm program will break up into three cleanly separated parts:\n\nModel — the state of your application\nUpdate — a way to update your state\nView — a way to view your state as HTML\n\nThis pattern is so reliable that I always start with the following skeleton and fill in details for my particular case.\nimport Html exposing (..)\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model = { ... }\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg = Reset | ...\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Reset -> ...\n    ...\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  ...\n\nThat is really the essence of The Elm Architecture! We will proceed by filling in this skeleton with increasingly interesting logic.\n"},"architecture/user_input/":{"url":"architecture/user_input/","title":"User Input","keywords":"","body":"The Elm Architecture + User Input\nYour web app is going to need to deal with user input. This section will get you familiar with The Elm Architecture in the context of things like:\n\nButtons\nText Fields\nCheck Boxes\nRadio Buttons\netc.\n\nWe will go through a few examples that build knowledge gradually, so go in order!\nFollow Along\nIn the last section we used elm-repl to get comfortable with Elm expressions. In this section, we are switching to creating Elm files of our own. You can do that in the online editor, or if you have Elm installed, you can follow these simple instructions to get everything working on your computer!\n"},"architecture/user_input/buttons.html":{"url":"architecture/user_input/buttons.html","title":"Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Buttons\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nOur first example is a simple counter that can be incremented or decremented. I find that it can be helpful to see the entire program in one place, so here it is! We will break it down afterwards.\nimport Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)\nimport Html.Events exposing (onClick)\n\n\nmain =\n  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model = Int\n\nmodel : Model\nmodel =\n  0\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg = Increment | Decrement\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Increment ->\n      model + 1\n\n    Decrement ->\n      model - 1\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text \"-\" ]\n    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]\n    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text \"+\" ]\n    ]\n\nThat's everything!\n\nNote: This section has type and type alias declarations. You can read all about these in the upcoming section on types. You do not need to deeply understand that stuff now, but you are free to jump ahead if it helps.\n\nWhen writing this program from scratch, I always start by taking a guess at the model. To make a counter, we at least need to keep track of a number that is going up and down. So let's just start with that!\ntype alias Model = Int\n\nNow that we have a model, we need to define how it changes over time. I always start my UPDATE section by defining a set of messages that we will get from the UI:\ntype Msg = Increment | Decrement\n\nI definitely know the user will be able to increment and decrement the counter. The Msg type describes these capabilities as data. Important! From there, the update function just describes what to do when you receive one of these messages.\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Increment ->\n      model + 1\n\n    Decrement ->\n      model - 1\n\nIf you get an Increment message, you increment the model. If you get a Decrement message, you decrement the model. Pretty straight-forward stuff.\nOkay, so that's all good, but how do we actually make some HTML and show it on screen? Elm has a library called elm-lang/html that gives you full access to HTML5 as normal Elm functions:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text \"-\" ]\n    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]\n    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text \"+\" ]\n    ]\n\nYou can see more examples of basic HTML here.\nOne thing to notice is that our view function is producing a Html Msg value. This means that it is a chunk of HTML that can produce Msg values. And when you look at the definition, you see the onClick attributes are set to give out Increment and Decrement values. These will get fed directly into our update function, driving our whole app forward.\nAnother thing to notice is that div and button are just normal Elm functions. These functions take (1) a list of attributes and (2) a list of child nodes. It is just HTML with slightly different syntax. Instead of having  and > everywhere, we have [ and ]. We have found that folks who can read HTML have a pretty easy time learning to read this variation. Okay, but why not have it be exactly like HTML? Since we are using normal Elm functions, we have the full power of the Elm programming language to help us build our views! We can refactor repetitive code out into functions. We can put helpers in modules and import them just like any other code. We can use the same testing frameworks and libraries as any other Elm code. Everything that is nice about programming in Elm is 100% available to help you with your view. No need for a hacked together templating language!\nThere is also something a bit deeper going on here. The view code is entirely declarative. We take in a Model and produce some Html. That is it. There is no need to mutate the DOM manually, Elm takes care of that behind the scenes. This gives Elm much more freedom to make clever optimizations and ends up making rendering faster overall. So you write less code and the code runs faster. The best kind of abstraction!\nThis pattern is the essence of The Elm Architecture. Every example we see from now on will be a slight variation on this basic pattern: Model, update, view.\n\nExercise: One cool thing about The Elm Architecture is that it is super easy to extend as our product requirements change. Say your product manager has come up with this amazing \"reset\" feature. A new button that will reset the counter to zero.\nTo add the feature you come back to the Msg type and add another possibility: Reset. You then move on to the update function and describe what happens when you get that message. Finally you add a button in your view.\nSee if you can implement the \"reset\" feature!\n\n"},"architecture/user_input/text_fields.html":{"url":"architecture/user_input/text_fields.html","title":"Text Fields","keywords":"","body":"Text Fields\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nWe are about to create a simple app that reverses the contents of a text field. This example also introduces some new stuff that will help us out in our next example.\nAgain this is a pretty short program, so I have included the whole thing here. Skim through to get an idea of how everything fits together. Right after that we will go into much more detail!\nimport Html exposing (Html, Attribute, div, input, text)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Html.Events exposing (onInput)\n\n\nmain =\n  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model =\n  { content : String\n  }\n\nmodel : Model\nmodel =\n  { content = \"\" }\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg\n  = Change String\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Change newContent ->\n      { model | content = newContent }\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ input [ placeholder \"Text to reverse\", onInput Change ] []\n    , div [] [ text (String.reverse model.content) ]\n    ]\n\nThis code is a slight variant of the counter from the previous section. You set up a model. You define some messages. You say how to update. You make your view. The difference is just in how we filled this skeleton in. Let's walk through that!\nAs always, you start by guessing at what your Model should be. In our case, we know we are going to have to keep track of whatever the user has typed into the text field. We need that information so we know how to render the reversed text.\ntype alias Model =\n  { content : String\n  }\n\nThis time I chose to represent the model as a record. (You can read more about records here and here.) For now, the record stores the user input in the content field.\n\nNote: You may be wondering, why bother having a record if it only holds one entry? Couldn't you just use the string directly? Yes, of course! But starting with a record makes it easy to add more fields as our app gets more complicated. When the time comes where we want two text inputs, we will have to do much less fiddling around.\n\nOkay, so we have our model. Now in this app there is only one kind of message really. The user can change the contents of the text field.\ntype Msg\n  = Change String\n\nThis means our update function just has to handle this one case:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Change newContent ->\n      { model | content = newContent }\n\nWhen we receive new content, we use the record update syntax to update the contents of content.\nFinally we need to say how to view our application:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ input [ placeholder \"Text to reverse\", onInput Change ] []\n    , div [] [ text (String.reverse model.content) ]\n    ]\n\nWe create a  with two children.\nThe interesting child is the  node. In addition to the placeholder attribute, it uses onInput to declare what messages should be sent when the user types into this input.\nThis onInput function is kind of interesting. It takes one argument, in this case the Change function which was created when we declared the Msg type:\nChange : String -> Msg\n\nThis function is used to tag whatever is currently in the text field. So let's say the text field currently holds yol and the user types o. This triggers an input event, so we will get the message Change \"yolo\" in our update function.\nSo now we have a simple text field that can reverse user input. Neat! Now on to putting a bunch of text fields together into a more traditional form.\n"},"architecture/user_input/forms.html":{"url":"architecture/user_input/forms.html","title":"Forms","keywords":"","body":"Forms\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nHere we will make a rudimentary form. It has a field for your name, a field for your password, and a field to verify that password. We will also do some very simple validation (do the two passwords match?) just because it is simple to add.\nThe code is a bit longer in this case, but I still think it is valuable to look through it before you get into the description of what is going on.\nimport Html exposing (..)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Html.Events exposing (onInput)\n\n\nmain =\n  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model =\n  { name : String\n  , password : String\n  , passwordAgain : String\n  }\n\n\nmodel : Model\nmodel =\n  Model \"\" \"\" \"\"\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg\n    = Name String\n    | Password String\n    | PasswordAgain String\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Name name ->\n      { model | name = name }\n\n    Password password ->\n      { model | password = password }\n\n    PasswordAgain password ->\n      { model | passwordAgain = password }\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ input [ type_ \"text\", placeholder \"Name\", onInput Name ] []\n    , input [ type_ \"password\", placeholder \"Password\", onInput Password ] []\n    , input [ type_ \"password\", placeholder \"Re-enter Password\", onInput PasswordAgain ] []\n    , viewValidation model\n    ]\n\nviewValidation : Model -> Html msg\nviewValidation model =\n  let\n    (color, message) =\n      if model.password == model.passwordAgain then\n        (\"green\", \"OK\")\n      else\n        (\"red\", \"Passwords do not match!\")\n  in\n    div [ style [(\"color\", color)] ] [ text message ]\n\nThis is pretty much exactly how our text field example looked, just with more fields. Let's walk through how it came to be!\nAs always, you start out by guessing at the Model. We know there are going to be three text fields, so let's just go with that:\ntype alias Model =\n  { name : String\n  , password : String\n  , passwordAgain : String\n  }\n\nGreat, seems reasonable. We expect that each of these fields can be changed separately, so our messages should account for each of those scenarios.\ntype Msg\n    = Name String\n    | Password String\n    | PasswordAgain String\n\nThis means our update is pretty mechanical. Just update the relevant field:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Name name ->\n      { model | name = name }\n\n    Password password ->\n      { model | password = password }\n\n    PasswordAgain password ->\n      { model | passwordAgain = password }\n\nWe get a little bit fancier than normal in our view though.\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ input [ type_ \"text\", placeholder \"Name\", onInput Name ] []\n    , input [ type_ \"password\", placeholder \"Password\", onInput Password ] []\n    , input [ type_ \"password\", placeholder \"Re-enter Password\", onInput PasswordAgain ] []\n    , viewValidation model\n    ]\n\nIt starts out normal: We create a  and put a couple  nodes in it. Each one has an onInput attribute that will tag any changes appropriately for our update function. (This is all building off of the text field example in the previous section.)\nBut for the last child we do not directly use an HTML function. Instead we call the viewValidation function, passing in the current model.\nviewValidation : Model -> Html msg\nviewValidation model =\n  let\n    (color, message) =\n      if model.password == model.passwordAgain then\n        (\"green\", \"OK\")\n      else\n        (\"red\", \"Passwords do not match!\")\n  in\n    div [ style [(\"color\", color)] ] [ text message ]\n\nThis function first compares the two passwords. If they match, you want green text and a positive message. If they do not match, you want red text and a helpful message. With that info, we produce a  filled with a colorful message explaining the situation.\nThis starts to show the benefits of having our HTML library be normal Elm code. It would have looked really weird to jam all that code into our view. In Elm, you just refactor like you would with any other code!\nOn these same lines, you may notice that the  nodes all are created with pretty similar code. Say we made each input fancier: there is an outer  that holds a  and an  with certain classes. It would make total sense to break that pattern out into a viewInput function so you never have to repeat yourself. This also means you change it in one place and everyone gets the updated HTML.\n\nExercises: One cool thing about breaking viewValidation out is that it is pretty easy to augment. If you are messing with the code as you read through this (as you should be!) you should try to:\n\nCheck that the password is longer than 8 characters.\nMake sure the password contains upper case, lower case, and numeric characters.\nAdd an additional field for age and check that it is a number.\nAdd a \"Submit\" button. Only show errors after it has been pressed.\n\nBe sure to use the helpers in the String library if you try any of these! Also, we need to learn more before we start talking to servers, so before you try that here, keep reading until HTTP is introduced. It will be significantly easier with proper guidance!\n\n"},"architecture/user_input/more.html":{"url":"architecture/user_input/more.html","title":"More","keywords":"","body":"More About User Input\nWe only covered buttons and text fields, but there are other crazier inputs that you will need eventually.\nSo if you want to see examples of radio buttons and check boxes, visit the Elm examples page which has a bunch of small examples you can mess around with.

Maybe try incorporating check boxes into the form example?\nThat said, I want to keep up the momentum of this tutorial and keep introducing new concepts, so next we will be looking at how to work with things like HTTP and web sockets!\n"},"architecture/effects/":{"url":"architecture/effects/","title":"Effects","keywords":"","body":"The Elm Architecture + Effects\nThe last section showed how to handle all sorts of user input. You can think of those programs like this:\n\nFrom our perspective, we just receive messages and produce new Html to get rendered on screen. The “Elm Runtime” is sitting there behind the scenes. When it gets Html it figures out how to render it on screen really fast. When a user clicks on something, it figures out how to pipe that into our program as a Msg. So the Elm Runtime is in charge of doing stuff. We just transform data.\nThis section builds on that pattern, giving you the ability to make HTTP requests or subscribe to messages from web sockets. Think of it like this:\n\nInstead of just producing Html, we will now be producing commands and subscriptions:\n\nCommands — A Cmd lets you do stuff: generate a random number, send an HTTP request, etc.\n\nSubscriptions — A Sub lets you register that you are interested in something: tell me about location changes, listen for web socket messages, etc.\n\n\nIf you squint, commands and subscriptions are pretty similar to Html values. With Html, we never touch the DOM by hand. Instead we represent the desired HTML as data and let the Elm Runtime do some clever stuff to make it render really fast. It is the same with commands and subscriptions. We create data that describes what we want to do, and the Elm Runtime does the dirty work.\nDon’t worry if it seems a bit confusing for now, the examples will help! So first let’s look at how to fit these concepts into the code we have seen before.\nExtending the Architecture Skeleton\nSo far our architecture skeleton has focused on creating Model types and update and view functions. To handle commands and subscriptions, we need to extend the basic architecture skeleton a little bit:\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model =\n  { ...\n  }\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg = Submit | ...\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  ...\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  ...\n\n\n-- SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions model =\n  ...\n\n\n-- INIT\n\ninit : (Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n  ...\n\nThe first three sections are almost exactly the same, but there are a few new things overall:\n\nThe update function now returns more than just a new model. It returns a new model and some commands you want to run. These commands are all going to produce Msg values that will get fed right back into our update function.\n\nThere is a subscriptions function. This function lets you declare any event sources you need to subscribe to given the current model. Just like with Html Msg and Cmd Msg, these subscriptions will produce Msg values that get fed right back into our update function.\n\nSo far init has just been the initial model. Now it produces both a model and some commands, just like the new update. This lets us provide a starting value and kick off any HTTP requests or whatever that are needed for initialization.\n\n\nNow it is totally okay if this does not really make sense yet! That only really happens when you start seeing it in action, so let’s hop right into the examples!\n\nAside: One crucial detail here is that commands and subscriptions are data. When you create a command, you do not actually do it. Same with commands in real life. Let’s try it. Eat an entire watermelon in one bite! Did you do it? No! You kept reading before you even thought about buying a tiny watermelon.\nPoint is, commands and subscriptions are data. You hand them to Elm to actually run them, giving Elm a chance to log all of this information. In the end, effects-as-data means Elm can:\n\nHave a general purpose time-travel debugger.\nKeep the \"same input, same output\" guarantee for all Elm functions.\nAvoid setup/teardown phases when testing update logic.\nCache and batch effects, minimizing HTTP connections or other resources.\n\nSo without going too crazy on details, pretty much all the nice guarantees and tools you have in Elm come from the choice to treat effects as data! I think this will make more sense as you get deeper into Elm.\n\n"},"architecture/effects/random.html":{"url":"architecture/effects/random.html","title":"Random","keywords":"","body":"Random\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nWe are about to make an app that \"rolls dice\", producing a random number between 1 and 6.\nWhen I write code with effects, I usually break it into two phases. Phase one is about getting something on screen, just doing the bare minimum to have something to work from. Phase two is filling in details, gradually approaching the actual goal. We will use this process here too.\nPhase One - The Bare Minimum\nAs always, you start out by guessing at what your Model should be:\ntype alias Model =\n  { dieFace : Int\n  }\n\nFor now we will just track dieFace as an integer between 1 and 6. Then I would quickly sketch out the view function because it seems like the easiest next step.\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ h1 [] [ text (toString model.dieFace) ]\n    , button [ onClick Roll ] [ text \"Roll\" ]\n    ]\n\nSo this is typical. Same stuff we have been doing with the user input examples of The Elm Architecture. When you click our  it is going to produce a Roll message, so I guess it is time to take a first pass at the update function as well.\ntype Msg = Roll\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Roll ->\n      (model, Cmd.none)\n\nNow the update function has the same overall shape as before, but the return type is a bit different. Instead of just giving back a Model, it produces both a Model and a command. The idea is: we still want to step the model forward, but we also want to do some stuff. In our case, we want to ask Elm to give us a random value. For now, I just fill it in with Cmd.none which means \"I have no commands, do nothing.\" We will fill this in with the good stuff in phase two.\nFinally, I would create an init value like this:\ninit : (Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n  (Model 1, Cmd.none)\n\nHere we specify both the initial model and some commands we'd like to run immediately when the app starts. This is exactly the kind of stuff that update is producing now too.\nWhile we aren't using subscriptions in this example, remember that the architecture skeleton has changed to include them. The main should reflect this, since we aren't using the Html.beginnerProgram anymore.\nmain =\n  Html.program\n    { init = init\n    , view = view\n    , update = update\n    , subscriptions = subscriptions\n    }\n\nAt this point, it is possible to wire it all up and take a look. You can click the , but nothing happens. Let's fix that!\nPhase Two - Adding the Cool Stuff\nThe obvious thing missing right now is the randomness! When the user clicks a button we want to command Elm to reach into its internal random number generator and give us a number between 1 and 6. The first step I would take towards that goal would be adding a new kind of message:\ntype Msg\n  = Roll\n  | NewFace Int\n\nWe still have Roll from before, but now we add NewFace for when Elm hands us our new random number. That is enough to start filling in update:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Roll ->\n      (model, Random.generate NewFace (Random.int 1 6))\n\n    NewFace newFace ->\n      (Model newFace, Cmd.none)\n\nThere are two new things here. First, there is now a branch for NewFace messages. When a NewFace comes in, we just step the model forward and do nothing. Second, we have added a real command to the Roll branch. This uses a couple functions from the Random library. Most important is Random.generate:\nRandom.generate : (a -> msg) -> Random.Generator a -> Cmd msg\n\nThis function takes two arguments. The first is a function to tag random values. In our case we want to use NewFace : Int -> Msg to turn the random number into a message for our update function. The second argument is a \"generator\" which is like a recipe for producing certain types of random values. You can have generators for simple types like Int or Float or Bool, but also for fancy types like big custom records with lots of fields. In this case, we use one of the simplest generators:\nRandom.int : Int -> Int -> Random.Generator Int\n\nYou provide a lower and upper bound on the integer, and now you have a generator that produces integers in that range!\nThat is it. Now we can click and see the number flip to some new value!\nSo the big lessons here are:\n\nWrite your programs bit by bit. Start with a simple skeleton, and gradually add the tougher stuff.\nThe update function now produces a new model and a command.\nYou cannot just get random values willy-nilly. You create a command, and Elm will go do some work behind the scenes to provide it for you. In fact, any time our program needs to get unreliable values (randomness, HTTP, file I/O, database reads, etc.) you have to go through Elm.\n\nAt this point, the best way to improve your understanding of commands is just to see more of them! They will appear prominently with the Http and WebSocket libraries, so if you are feeling shaky, the only path forward is practicing with randomness and playing with other examples of commands!\n\nExercises: Here are some that build on stuff that has already been introduced:\n\nInstead of showing a number, show the die face as an image.\nAdd a second die and have them both roll at the same time.\n\nAnd here are some that require new skills:\n\nInstead of showing an image of a die face, use the elm-lang/svg library to draw it yourself.\nAfter you have learned about tasks and animation, have the die flip around randomly before they settle on a final value.\n\n\n"},"architecture/effects/http.html":{"url":"architecture/effects/http.html","title":"HTTP","keywords":"","body":"HTTP\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nWe are about to make an app that fetches a random GIF when the user asks for another image.\nNow, I am going to assume you just read the randomness example.

Here we will be using the same two step process to build up to fancier kinds of commands, so I very highly recommend going back one page. I swear you will reach your goals faster if you start with a solid foundation!\n...\nOkay, so you read it now right? Good. Let's get started on our random gif fetcher!\nPhase One - The Bare Minimum\nAt this point in this guide, you should be pretty comfortable smacking down the basic skeleton of an Elm app. Guess at the model, fill in some messages, etc. etc.\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model =\n  { topic : String\n  , gifUrl : String\n  }\n\ninit : (Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n  (Model \"cats\" \"waiting.gif\", Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg = MorePlease\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    MorePlease ->\n      (model, Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ h2 [] [text model.topic]\n    , img [src model.gifUrl] []\n    , button [ onClick MorePlease ] [ text \"More Please!\" ]\n    ]\n\nFor the model, I decided to track a topic so I know what kind of gifs to fetch. I do not want to hard code it to \"cats\", and maybe later we will want to let the user decide the topic too. I also tracked the gifUrl which is a URL that points at some random gif.\nLike in the randomness example, I just made dummy init and update functions. None of them actually produce any commands for now. The point is just to get something on screen!\nPhase Two - Adding the Cool Stuff\nAlright, the obvious thing missing right now is the HTTP request. I think it is easiest to start this process by adding new kinds of messages. Now remember, when you give a command, you have to wait for it to happen. So when we command Elm to do an HTTP request, it is eventually going to tell you \"hey, here is what you wanted\" or it is going to say \"oops, something went wrong with the HTTP request\". We need this to be reflected in our messages:\ntype Msg\n  = MorePlease\n  | NewGif (Result Http.Error String)\n\nWe add a case for NewGif that holds a Result. You can read more about results here, but the key idea is that it captures the two possible outcomes of an HTTP request. It either (1) succeeded with the URL of a random gif or (2) failed with some HTTP error (server is down, bad URL, etc.)\nThat is enough to start filling in update:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    MorePlease ->\n      (model, getRandomGif model.topic)\n\n    NewGif (Ok newUrl) ->\n      ( { model | gifUrl = newUrl }, Cmd.none)\n\n    NewGif (Err _) ->\n      (model, Cmd.none)\n\nSo I added branches for our new messages. When NewGif holds a success, we update the gifUrl field to have the new URL. When NewGif holds an error, we ignore it, giving back the same model and doing nothing.\nI also changed the MorePlease branch a bit. We need an HTTP command, so I called the getRandomGif function. The trick is that I made that function up. It does not exist yet. That is the next step!\nDefining getRandomGif might look something like this:\ngetRandomGif : String -> Cmd Msg\ngetRandomGif topic =\n  let\n    url =\n      \"https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&tag=\" ++ topic\n\n    request =\n      Http.get url decodeGifUrl\n  in\n    Http.send NewGif request\n\ndecodeGifUrl : Decode.Decoder String\ndecodeGifUrl =\n  Decode.at [\"data\", \"image_url\"] Decode.string\n\nWith that added, the \"More\" button actually goes and fetches a random gif. Check it out here! But how does getRandomGif work exactly?\nIt starts out simple, we define url to be some giphy endpoint for random gifs. Next we create an HTTP request with Http.get. Finally, we turn it into a command with Http.send. Let’s break those steps down a bit more:\n\nHttp.get : String -> Decode.Decoder value -> Http.Request value\nThis function takes a URL and a JSON decoder. This is our first time seeing a JSON decoder (and we will cover them in depth later), but for now, you really just need a high-level understanding. It turns JSON into Elm. In our case, we defined decodeGifUrl which tries to find a string value at json.data.image_url. Between the URL and the JSON decoder, we create an Http.Request. This is similar to a Random.Generator like we saw in the previous example. It does not actually do anything. It just describes how to make an HTTP request.\n\nHttp.send : (Result Error value -> msg) -> Http.Request value -> Cmd msg\nOnce we have an HTTP request, we can turn it into a command with Http.send. This is just like how we used Random.generate to create a command with a random generator. The first argument is a way to turn the result of the HTTP request into a message for our update function. In this case, we create a NewGif message.\n\n\nThis has been a very quick introduction, but the key idea is that you must (1) create an HTTP request and (2) turn that into a command so Elm will actually do it. You can go pretty far using the basic pattern here, and we will be looking into JSON decoders later on, which will let you deal with whatever crazy JSON you run into.\n\nExercises: To get more comfortable with this code, try augmenting it with skills we learned in previous sections:\n\nShow a message explaining why the image didn't change when you get an Http.Error.\nAllow the user to modify the topic with a text field.\nAllow the user to modify the topic with a drop down menu.\n\n\n"},"architecture/effects/time.html":{"url":"architecture/effects/time.html","title":"Time","keywords":"","body":"Time\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nWe are going to make a simple clock.\nSo far we have focused on commands. With the randomness example, we asked for a random value. With the HTTP example, we asked for info from a server. That pattern does not really work for a clock. In this case, we want to sit around and hear about clock ticks whenever they happen. This is where subscriptions come in.\nThe code is not too crazy here, so I am going to include it in full. After you read through, we will come back to normal words that explain it in more depth.\nimport Html exposing (Html)\nimport Svg exposing (..)\nimport Svg.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Time exposing (Time, second)\n\n\n\nmain =\n  Html.program\n    { init = init\n    , view = view\n    , update = update\n    , subscriptions = subscriptions\n    }\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model = Time\n\n\ninit : (Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n  (0, Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg\n  = Tick Time\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    Tick newTime ->\n      (newTime, Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions model =\n  Time.every second Tick\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  let\n    angle =\n      turns (Time.inMinutes model)\n\n    handX =\n      toString (50 + 40 * cos angle)\n\n    handY =\n      toString (50 + 40 * sin angle)\n  in\n    svg [ viewBox \"0 0 100 100\", width \"300px\" ]\n      [ circle [ cx \"50\", cy \"50\", r \"45\", fill \"#0B79CE\" ] []\n      , line [ x1 \"50\", y1 \"50\", x2 handX, y2 handY, stroke \"#023963\" ] []\n      ]\n\nThere is nothing new in the MODEL or UPDATE sections. Same old stuff. The view function is kind of interesting. Instead of using HTML, we use the Svg library to draw some shapes. It works just like HTML though. You provide a list of attributes and a list of children for every node.\nThe important thing comes in SUBSCRIPTIONS section. The subscriptions function takes in the model, and instead of returning Sub.none like in the examples we have seen so far, it gives back a real life subscription! In this case Time.every:\nTime.every : Time -> (Time -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\nThe first argument is a time interval. We chose to get ticks every second. The second argument is a function that turns the current time into a message for the update function. We are tagging times with Tick so the time 1458863979862 would become Tick 1458863979862.\nThat is all there is to setting up a subscription! These messages will be fed to your update function whenever they become available.\n\nExercises:\n\nAdd a button to pause the clock, turning the Time subscription off.\nMake the clock look nicer. Add an hour and minute hand. Etc.\n\n\n"},"architecture/effects/web_sockets.html":{"url":"architecture/effects/web_sockets.html","title":"Web Sockets","keywords":"","body":"Web Sockets\n\nClone the code or follow along in the online editor.\n\nWe are going to make a simple chat app. There will be a text field so you can type things in and a region that shows all the messages we have received so far. Web sockets are great for this scenario because they let us set up a persistent connection with the server. This means:\n\nYou can send messages cheaply whenever you want.\nThe server can send you messages whenever it feels like it.\n\nIn other words, WebSocket is one of the rare libraries that makes use of both commands and subscriptions.\nThis program happens to be pretty short, so here is the full thing:\nimport Html exposing (..)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Html.Events exposing (..)\nimport WebSocket\n\n\nmain =\n  Html.program\n    { init = init\n    , view = view\n    , update = update\n    , subscriptions = subscriptions\n    }\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\ntype alias Model =\n  { input : String\n  , messages : List String\n  }\n\n\ninit : (Model, Cmd Msg)\ninit =\n  (Model \"\" [], Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\ntype Msg\n  = Input String\n  | Send\n  | NewMessage String\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)\nupdate msg {input, messages} =\n  case msg of\n    Input newInput ->\n      (Model newInput messages, Cmd.none)\n\n    Send ->\n      (Model \"\" messages, WebSocket.send \"ws://echo.websocket.org\" input)\n\n    NewMessage str ->\n      (Model input (str :: messages), Cmd.none)\n\n\n-- SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions model =\n  WebSocket.listen \"ws://echo.websocket.org\" NewMessage\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ div [] (List.map viewMessage model.messages)\n    , input [onInput Input] []\n    , button [onClick Send] [text \"Send\"]\n    ]\n\n\nviewMessage : String -> Html msg\nviewMessage msg =\n  div [] [ text msg ]\n\nThe interesting parts are probably the uses of WebSocket.send and WebSocket.listen.\nFor simplicity we will target a simple server that just echos back whatever you type.

For example, union types are one of the most important features in the whole language and we have not focused on them at all!\nSo we are going to take a break from The Elm Architecture for a couple chapters to get a better understanding of Elm itself. We will come back to The Elm Architecture in a few chapters and focus on code reuse in larger applications. In the meantime, when a function gets so big it feels unmanageable in practice, make a helper function! Elm makes refactoring easy, so it is best to improve architecture as needed rather than preemptively. More about that later though!\nP.S. Best not to skip ahead. You can build a bigger house if you have a strong foundation!\n"},"types/":{"url":"types/","title":"Types","keywords":"","body":"Types\nOne of Elm's major benefits is that users do not see runtime errors in practice. This is possible because the Elm compiler can analyze your source code very quickly to see how values flow through your program. If a value can ever be used in an invalid way, the compiler tells you about it with a friendly error message. This is called type inference. The compiler figures out what type of values flow in and out of all your functions.\nAn Example of Type Inference\nThe following code defines a toFullName function which extracts a persons full name as a string:\ntoFullName person =\n  person.firstName ++ \" \" ++ person.lastName\n\nfullName =\n  toFullName { fistName = \"Hermann\", lastName = \"Hesse\" }\n\nLike in JavaScript or Python, we just write the code with no extra clutter. Do you see the bug though? \nIn JavaScript, the equivalent code spits out \"undefined Hesse\". Not even an error! Hopefully one of your users will tell you about it when they see it in the wild. In contrast, the Elm compiler just looks at the source code and tells you:\n-- TYPE MISMATCH ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe argument to function `toFullName` is causing a mismatch.\n\n6│   toFullName { fistName = \"Hermann\", lastName = \"Hesse\" }\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFunction `toFullName` is expecting the argument to be:\n\n    { …, firstName : … }\n\nBut it is:\n\n    { …, fistName : … }\n\nHint: I compared the record fields and found some potential typos.\n\n    firstName  fistName\nIt sees that toFullName is getting the wrong type of argument. Like the hint in the error message says, someone accidentally wrote fist instead of first.\nIt is great to have an assistant for simple mistakes like this, but it is even more valuable when you have hundreds of files and a bunch of collaborators making changes. No matter how big and complex things get, the Elm compiler checks that everything fits together properly just based on the source code.\nThe better you understand types, the more the compiler feels like a friendly assistant. So let's start learning more!\n"},"types/reading_types.html":{"url":"types/reading_types.html","title":"Reading Types","keywords":"","body":"Reading Types\nIn the Core Language section of this book, we ran a bunch of code in the REPL. Well, we are going to do it again, but now with an emphasis on the types that are getting spit out. So type elm repl in your terminal again. You should see this:\n---- elm repl 0.18.0 -----------------------------------------------------------\n :help for help, :exit to exit, more at \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n\nPrimitives and Lists\nLet's enter some simple expressions and see what happens:\n> \"hello\"\n\"hello\" : String\n\n> not True\nFalse : Bool\n\n> round 3.1415\n3 : Int\n\nIn these three examples, the REPL tells us the resulting value along with what type of value it happens to be. The value \"hello\" is a String. The value 3 is an Int. Nothing too crazy here.\nLet's see what happens with lists holding different types of values:\n> [ \"Alice\", \"Bob\" ]\n[ \"Alice\", \"Bob\" ] : List String\n\n> [ 1.0, 8.6, 42.1 ]\n[ 1.0, 8.6, 42.1 ] : List Float\n\n> []\n[] : List a\n\nIn the first case, we have a List filled with String values. In the second, the List is filled with Float values. In the third case the list is empty, so we do not actually know what kind of values are in the list. So the type List a is saying \"I know I have a list, but it could be filled with anything\". The lower-case a is called a type variable, meaning that there are no constraints in our program that pin this down to some specific type. In other words, the type can vary based on how it is used.\nFunctions\nLet's see the type of some functions:\n> import String\n> String.length\n : String -> Int\n\nThe function String.length has type String -> Int. This means it must take in a String argument, and it will definitely return an integer result. So let's try giving it an argument:\n> String.length \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"\n34 : Int\n\nThe important thing to understand here is how the type of the result Int is built up from the initial expression. We have a String -> Int function and give it a String argument. This results in an Int.\nWhat happens when you do not give a String though?\n> String.length [1,2,3]\n-- error!\n\n> String.length True\n-- error!\n\nA String -> Int function must get a String argument!\nAnonymous Functions\nElm has a feature called anonymous functions. Basically, you can create a function without naming it, like this:\n> \\n -> n / 2\n : Float -> Float\n\nBetween the backslash and the arrow, you list the arguments of the function, and on the right of the arrow, you say what to do with those arguments. In this example, it is saying: I take in some argument I will call n and then I am going to divide it by two.\nWe can use anonymous functions directly. Here is us using our anonymous function with 128 as the argument:\n> (\\n -> n / 2) 128\n64 : Float\n\nWe start with a Float -> Float function and give it a Float argument. The result is another Float.\n\nNotes: The backslash that starts an anonymous function is supposed to look like a lambda λ if you squint. This is a possibly ill-conceived wink to the intellectual history that led to languages like Elm.\nAlso, when we wrote the expression (\\n -> n / 2) 128, it is important that we put parentheses around the anonymous function. After the arrow, Elm is just going to keep reading code as long as it can. The parentheses put bounds on this, indicating where the function body ends.\n\nNamed Functions\nIn the same way that we can name a value, we can name an anonymous function. So rebellious!\n> oneHundredAndTwentyEight = 128.0\n128 : Float\n\n> half = \\n -> n / 2\n : Float -> Float\n\n> half oneHundredAndTwentyEight\n64 : Float\n\nIn the end, it works just like when nothing was named. You have a Float -> Float function, you give it a Float, and you end up with another Float.\nHere is the crazy secret though: this is how all functions are defined! You are just giving a name to an anonymous function. So when you see things like this:\n> half n = n / 2\n : Float -> Float\n\nYou can think of it as a convenient shorthand for:\n> half = \\n -> n / 2\n : Float -> Float\n\nThis is true for all functions, no matter how many arguments they have. So now let's take that a step farther and think about what it means for functions with multiple arguments:\n> divide x y = x / y\n : Float -> Float -> Float\n\n> divide 3 2\n1.5 : Float\n\nThat seems fine, but why are there two arrows in the type for divide?! To start out, it is fine to think that \"all the arguments are separated by arrows, and whatever is last is the result of the function\". So divide takes two arguments and returns a Float.\nTo really understand why there are two arrows in the type of divide, it helps to convert the definition to use anonymous functions.\n> divide x y = x / y\n : Float -> Float -> Float\n\n> divide x = \\y -> x / y\n : Float -> Float -> Float\n\n> divide = \\x -> (\\y -> x / y)\n : Float -> Float -> Float\n\nAll of these are totally equivalent. We just moved the arguments over, turning them into anonymous functions one at a time. So when we run an expression like divide 3 2 we are actually doing a bunch of evaluation steps:\n  divide 3 2\n  (divide 3) 2                 -- Step 1 - Add the implicit parentheses\n  ((\\x -> (\\y -> x / y)) 3) 2  -- Step 2 - Expand `divide`\n  (\\y -> 3 / y) 2              -- Step 3 - Replace x with 3\n  3 / 2                        -- Step 4 - Replace y with 2\n  1.5                          -- Step 5 - Do the math\n\nAfter you expand divide, you actually provide the arguments one at a time. Replacing x and y are actually two different steps.\nLet's break that down a bit more to see how the types work. In evaluation step #3 we saw the following function:\n> (\\y -> 3 / y)\n : Float -> Float\n\nIt is a Float -> Float function, just like half. Now in step #2 we saw a fancier function:\n> (\\x -> (\\y -> x / y))\n : Float -> Float -> Float\n\nWell, we are starting with \\x -> ... so we know the type is going to be something like Float -> .... We also know that (\\y -> x / y) has type Float -> Float.\nSo if you actually wrote down all the parentheses in the type, it would instead say Float -> (Float -> Float). You provide arguments one at a time. So when you replace x, the result is actually another function.\nIt is the same with all functions in Elm:\n> import String\n> String.repeat\n : Int -> String -> String\n\nThis is really Int -> (String -> String) because you are providing the arguments one at a time.\nBecause all functions in Elm work this way, you do not need to give all the arguments at once. It is possible to say things like this:\n> divide 128\n : Float -> Float\n\n> String.repeat 3\n : String -> String\n\nThis is called partial application. It lets us use \">the |> operator to chain functions together in a nice way, and it is why function types have so many arrows!\nType Annotations\nSo far we have just let Elm figure out the types, but it also lets you write a type annotation on the line above a definition if you want. So when you are writing code, you can say things like this:\nhalf : Float -> Float\nhalf n =\n  n / 2\n\ndivide : Float -> Float -> Float\ndivide x y =\n  x / y\n\naskVegeta : Int -> String\naskVegeta powerLevel =\n  if powerLevel > 9000 then\n    \"It's over 9000!!!\"\n\n  else\n    \"It is \" ++ toString powerLevel ++ \".\"\n\nPeople can make mistakes in type annotations, so what happens if they say the wrong thing? Well, the compiler does not make mistakes, so it still figures out the type on its own. It then checks that your annotation matches the real answer. In other words, the compiler will always verify that all the annotations you add are correct.\n\nNote: Some folks feel that it is odd that the type annotation goes on the line above the actual definition. The reasoning is that it should be easy and noninvasive to add a type annotation later. This way you can turn a sloppy prototype into higher-quality code just by adding lines.\n\n"},"types/type_aliases.html":{"url":"types/type_aliases.html","title":"Type Aliases","keywords":"","body":"Type Aliases\nThe whole point of type aliases is to make your type annotations easier to read.\nAs your programs get more complicated, you find yourself working with larger and more complex data. For example, maybe you are making twitter-for-dogs and you need to represent a user. And maybe you want a function that checks to see if a user has a bio or not. You might write a function like this:\nhasBio : { name : String, bio : String, pic : String } -> Bool\nhasBio user =\n  String.length user.bio > 0\n\nThat type annotation is kind of a mess, and users do not even have that many details! Imagine if there were ten fields. Or if you had a function that took users as an argument and gave users as the result.\nIn cases like this, you should create a type alias for your data:\ntype alias User =\n  { name : String\n  , bio : String\n  , pic : String\n  }\n\nThis is saying, wherever you see User, replace it by all this other stuff. So now we can rewrite our hasBio function in a much nicer way:\nhasBio : User -> Bool\nhasBio user =\n  String.length user.bio > 0\n\nLooks way better! It is important to emphasize that these two definitions are exactly the same. We just made an alias so we can say the same thing in fewer key strokes.\nSo if we write a function to add a bio, it would be like this:\naddBio : String -> User -> User\naddBio bio user =\n  { user | bio = bio }\n\nImagine what that type annotation would look like if we did not have the User type alias. Bad!\nType aliases are not just about cosmetics though. They can help you think more clearly. When writing Elm programs, it is often best to start with the type alias before writing a bunch of functions. I find it helps direct my progress in a way that ends up being more efficient overall. Suddenly you know exactly what kind of data you are working with. If you need to add stuff to it, the compiler will tell you about any existing code that is affected by it. I think most experienced Elm folks use a similar process when working with records especially.\n\nNote: When you create a type alias specifically for a record, it also generates a record constructor. So our User type alias will also generate this function:\nUser : String -> String -> String -> User\n\nThe arguments are in the order they appear in the type alias declaration, so in the REPL you could do this:\n> type alias User = { name : String, bio : String, pic : String }\n\n> User \"Tom\" \"Friendly Carpenter\" \"http://example.com/tom.jpg\"\n{ name = \"Tom\", bio = \"Friendly Carpenter\", pic = \"http://example.com/tom.jpg\" } : User\n\nThis can be pretty handy!\n\n"},"types/union_types.html":{"url":"types/union_types.html","title":"Union Types","keywords":"","body":"Union Types\nMany languages have trouble expressing data with weird shapes. They give you a small set of built-in types, and you have to represent everything with them. So you often find yourself using null or booleans or strings to encode details in a way that is quite error prone.\nElm's union types let you represent complex data much more naturally. We will go through a couple concrete examples to build some intuition about how and when to use union types.\n\nNote: Union types are sometimes called tagged unions. Some communities call them ADTs.\n\nFiltering a Todo List\n\nProblem: We are creating a todo list full of tasks. We want to have three views: show all tasks, show only active tasks, and show only completed tasks. How do we represent which of these three states we are in?\n\nWhenever you have weird shaped data in Elm, you want to reach for a union type. In this case, we would create a type Visibility that has three possible values:\n> type Visibility = All | Active | Completed\n\n> All\nAll : Visibility\n\n> Active\nActive : Visibility\n\n> Completed\nCompleted : Visibility\n\nNow that we have these three cases defined, we want to create a function keep that will properly filter our tasks. It should work like this:\ntype alias Task = { task : String, complete : Bool }\n\nbuy : Task\nbuy =\n  { task = \"Buy milk\", complete = True }\n\ndrink : Task\ndrink =\n  { task = \"Drink milk\", complete = False }\n\ntasks : List Task\ntasks =\n  [ buy, drink ]\n\n\n-- keep : Visibility -> List Task -> List Task\n\n-- keep All tasks == [buy,drink]\n-- keep Active tasks == [drink]\n-- keep Complete tasks == [buy]\n\nSo the keep function needs to look at its first argument, and depending on what it is, filter the list in various ways. We use a case expression to do this. It is like an if on steroids:\nkeep : Visibility -> List Task -> List Task\nkeep visibility tasks =\n  case visibility of\n    All ->\n      tasks\n\n    Active ->\n      List.filter (\\task -> not task.complete) tasks\n\n    Completed ->\n      List.filter (\\task -> task.complete) tasks\n\nThe case is saying, look at the structure of visibility. If it is All, just give back all the tasks. If it is Active, keep only the tasks that are not complete. If it is Completed, keep only the tasks that are complete.\nThe cool thing about case expressions is that all the branches are checked by the compiler. This has some nice benefits:\n\nIf you mistype Compleet by accident, you get a hint about the typo.\nIf you forget to handle a case, the compiler will figure it out and tell you.\n\nSo say you want to add Recent as a fourth possible Visibility value. The compiler will find all the case expressions in your code that work with Visibility values and remind you to handle the new possibility! This means you can change and extend Visibility without the risk of silently creating bugs in existing code.\n\nExercise: Imagine how you would solve this same problem in JavaScript. Three strings? A boolean that can be null? What would the definition of keep look like? What sort of tests would you want to write to make sure adding new code later was safe.\n\nAnonymous Users\n\nProblem: We have a chat room where people can post whatever they want. Some users are logged in and some are anonymous. How should we represent a user?\n\nAgain, whenever there is weird shaped data, you want to reach for a union type. For this case, we want one where users are either anonymous or named:\n> type User = Anonymous | Named String\n\n> Anonymous\nAnonymous : User\n\n> Named\n : String -> User\n\n> Named \"AzureDiamond\"\nNamed \"AzureDiamond\" : User\n\n> Named \"abraham-lincoln\"\nNamed \"abraham-lincoln\" : User\n\nSo creating the type User also created constructors named Anonymous and Named. If you want to create a User you must use one of these two constructors. This guarantees that all the possible User values are things like:\n  Anonymous\n  Named \"AzureDiamond\"\n  Named \"abraham-lincoln\"\n  Named \"catface420\"\n  Named \"Tom\"\n  ...\n\nNow that we have a representation of a user, lets say we want to get a photo of them to show next to their posts. Again, we need to use a case expression to work with our User type:\nuserPhoto : User -> String\nuserPhoto user =\n  case user of\n    Anonymous ->\n      \"anon.png\"\n\n    Named name ->\n      \"users/\" ++ name ++ \".png\"\n\nThere are two possible cases when we have a User. If they are Anonymous we show a dummy picture. If they are Named we construct the URL of their photo. This case is slightly fancier than the one we saw before. Notice that the second branch has a lower case variable name. This means that when we see a value like Named \"AzureDiamond\", the name variable will be bound to \"AzureDiamond\" so we can do other things with it. This is called pattern matching.\nNow imagine we have a bunch of users in a chat room and we want to show their pictures.\nactiveUsers : List User\nactiveUsers =\n  [ Anonymous, Named \"catface420\", Named \"AzureDiamond\", Anonymous ]\n\nphotos : List String\nphotos =\n  List.map userPhoto activeUsers\n\n-- [ \"anon.png\", \"users/catface420.png\", \"users/AzureDiamond.png\", \"anon.png\" ]\n\nThe nice thing about creating a type like User is that no one in your whole codebase can ever \"forget\" that some users may be anonymous. Anyone who can get a hold of a User needs to use a case to get any information out of it, and the compiler guarantees every case and handles all possible scenarios!\n\nExercise: Think about how you would solve this problem in some other language. A string where empty string means they are anonymous? A string that can be null? How much testing would you want to do to make sure that everyone handles these special cases correctly?\n\nWidget Dashboard\n\nProblem: You are creating a dashboard with three different kinds of widgets. One shows recent log data, one shows time plots, and one shows scatter plots. How do you represent a widget?\n\nAlright, we are getting a bit fancier now. In Elm, you want to start by solving each case individually. (As you get more experience, you will see that Elm wants you to build programs out of small, reusable parts. It is weird.) So I would create representations for each of our three scenarios, along with view functions to actually turn them into HTML or SVG or whatever:\ntype alias LogsInfo =\n  { logs : List String\n  }\n\ntype alias TimeInfo =\n  { events : List (Time, Float)\n  , yAxis : String\n  }\n\ntype alias ScatterInfo =\n  { points : List (Float, Float)\n  , xAxis : String\n  , yAxis : String\n  }\n\n-- viewLogs : LogsInfo -> Html msg\n-- viewTime : TimeInfo -> Html msg\n-- viewScatter : ScatterInfo -> Html msg\n\nAt this point, you have created all the helper functions needed to work with these three cases totally independent from each other. Someone can come along later and say, \"I need a nice way to show scatter plots\" and use just that part of the code.\nSo the question is really: how do I put these three standalone things together for my particular scenario?\nAgain, union types are there to put together a bunch of different types!\n> type Widget = Logs LogsInfo | TimePlot TimeInfo | ScatterPlot ScatterInfo\n\n> Logs\n : LogsInfo -> Widget\n\n> TimePlot\n : TimeInfo -> Widget\n\n> ScatterPlot\n : ScatterInfo -> Widget\n\nSo we created a Widget type that can only be created with these constructor functions. You can think of these constructors as tagging the data so we can tell it apart at runtime. Now we can write something to render a widget like this:\nview : Widget -> Html msg\nview widget =\n  case widget of\n    Logs info ->\n      viewLogs info\n\n    TimePlot info ->\n      viewTime info\n\n    ScatterPlot info ->\n      viewScatter info\n\nOne nice thing about this approach is that there is no mystery about what kind of widgets are supported. There are exactly three. If someone wants to add a fourth, they modify the Widget type. This means you can never be surprised by the data you get, even if someone on a different team is messing with your code.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nSolve each subproblem first.\nUse union types to put together all the solutions.\nCreating a union type generates a bunch of constructors.\nThese constuctors tag data so that we can differentiate it at runtime.\nA case expression lets us tear data apart based on these tags.\n\nThe same strategies can be used if you are making a game and have a bunch of different bad guys. Goombas should update one way, but Koopa Troopas do something totally different. Solve each problem independently, and then use a union type to put them all together.\n\nLinked Lists\n\nProblem: You are stuck on a bus speeding down the highway. If the bus slows down, it will blow up. The only way to save yourself and everyone on the bus is to reimplement linked lists in Elm. HURRY, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF GAS!\n\nYeah, yeah, the problem is contrived this time, but it is important to see some of the more advanced things you can do with union types!\nA linked list is a sequence of values. If you are looking at a linked list, it is either empty or it is a value and more list. That list is either empty or is a value and more list. etc. This intuitive definition works pretty directly in Elm. Let's see it for lists of integers:\n> type IntList = Empty | Node Int IntList\n\n> Empty\nEmpty : IntList\n\n> Node\n : Int -> IntList -> IntList\n\n> Node 42 Empty\nNode 42 Empty : IntList\n\n> Node 64 (Node 128 Empty)\nNode 64 (Node 128 Empty) : IntList\n\nNow we did two new things here:\n\nThe Node constructor takes two arguments instead of one. This is fine. In fact, you can have them take as many arguments as you want.\nOur union type is recursive. An IntList may hold another IntList. Again, this is fine if you are using union types.\n\nThe nice thing about our IntList type is that now we can only build valid linked lists. Every linked list needs to start with Empty and the only way to add a new value is with Node.\nIt is equally nice to work with. Let's say we want to compute the sum of all of the numbers in a list. Just like with any other union type, we need to use a case and handle all possible scenarios:\nsum : IntList -> Int\nsum numbers =\n  case numbers of\n    Empty ->\n      0\n\n    Node n remainingNumbers ->\n      n + sum remainingNumbers\n\nIf we get an Empty value, the sum is 0. If we have a Node we add the first element to the sum of all the remaining ones. So an expression like (sum (Node 1 (Node 2 (Node 3 Empty)))) is evaluated like this:\n  sum (Node 1 (Node 2 (Node 3 Empty)))\n  1 + sum (Node 2 (Node 3 Empty))\n  1 + (2 + sum (Node 3 Empty))\n  1 + (2 + (3 + sum Empty))\n  1 + (2 + (3 + 0))\n  1 + (2 + 3)\n  1 + 5\n  6\n\nOn each line, we see one evaluation step. When we call sum it transforms the list based on whether it is looking at a Node or an Empty value.\n\nNote: This is the first recursive function we have written together! Notice that sum calls itself to get the sum. It can be tricky to get into the mindset of writing recursive functions, so I wanted to share one weird trick. Pretend you are already done.\nI always start with a case and all of the branches listed but not filled in. From there, I solve each branch one at a time, pretending that nothing else exists. So with sum I'd look at Empty -> and say, an empty list has to sum to zero. Then I'd look at the Node n remainingNumbers -> branch and think, well, I know I have a number, a list, and a sum function that definitely already exists and totally works. I can just use that and add a number to it!\n\nGeneric Data Structures\n\nProblem: The last section showed linked lists that only worked for integers. That is pretty lame. How can we make linked lists that hold any kind of value?\n\nEverything is going to be pretty much the same, except we are going to introduce a type variable in our definition of lists:\n> type List a = Empty | Node a (List a)\n\n> Empty\nEmpty : List a\n\n> Node\n : a -> List a -> List a\n\n> Node \"hi\" Empty\nNode \"hi\" Empty : List String\n\n> Node 1.618 (Node 6.283 Empty)\nNode 1.618 (Node 6.283 Empty) : List Float\n\nThe fancy part comes in the Node constructor. Instead of pinning the data to Int and IntList, we say that it can hold a and List a. Basically, you can add a value as long as it is the same type of value as everything else in the list.\nEverything else is the same. You pattern match on lists with case and you write recursive functions. The only difference is that our lists can hold anything now!\n\nExercise: This is exactly how the List type in Elm works, so take a look at the List library and see if you can implement some of those functions yourself.\n\nAdditional Examples\nWe have seen a couple scenarios, but the best way to get more comfortable is to use union types more! So here are two examples that are kind of fun.\nBinary Trees\nBinary trees are almost exactly the same as linked lists:\n> type Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)\n\n> Node\n : a -> Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a\n\n> Node \"hi\" Empty Empty\nNode \"hi\" Empty Empty : Tree String\n\nA tree is either empty or it is a node with a value and two children. Check out this example for more info on this. If you can do all of the exercises at the end of that link, consider yourself a capable user of union types!\nLanguages\nWe can even model a programming language as data if we want to go really crazy! In this case, it is one that only deals with Boolean algebra:\ntype Boolean\n    = T\n    | F\n    | Not Boolean\n    | And Boolean Boolean\n    | Or Boolean Boolean\n\ntrue = Or T F\nfalse = And T (Not T)\n\nOnce we have modeled the possible values we can define functions like eval which evaluates any Boolean to True or False. See this example for more about representing boolean expressions.\n"},"error_handling/":{"url":"error_handling/","title":"Error Handling and Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling and Tasks\nOne of the guarantees of Elm is that you will not see runtime errors in practice. NoRedInk has been using Elm in production for about a year now, and they still have not had one! Like all guarantees in Elm, this comes down to fundamental language design choices. In this case, we are helped by the fact that Elm treats errors as data. (Have you noticed we make things data a lot here?)\nThis section is going to walk through three data structures that help you handle errors in a couple different ways.\n\nMaybe\nResult\nTask\n\nNow some of you probably want to jump right to tasks, but trust me that going in order will help here! You can think of these three data structures as a progression that slowly address crazier and crazier situations. So if you jump in at the end, it will be a lot to figure out all at once.\nSome Historical Context\nThere are two popular language features that consistently cause unexpected problems. If you have used Java or C or JavaScript or Python or Ruby, you have almost certainly had your code crash because of null values or surprise exceptions from someone else's code.\nNow these things are extremely familiar to folks, but that does not mean they are good!\nNull\nAny time you think you have a String you just might have a null instead. Should you check? Did the person giving you the value check? Maybe it will be fine? Maybe it will crash your servers? I guess we will find out later!\nThe inventor, Tony Hoare, has this to say about it:\n\nI call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.\n\nAs we will see soon, the point of Maybe is to avoid this problem in a pleasant way.\nExceptions\nJoel Spolsky outlined the issues with exceptions pretty nicely in the year 2003. Essentially, code that looks fine may actually crash at runtime. Surprise!\nThe point of Result is to make the possibility of failure clear and make sure it is handled appropriately.\nThe point of Task is pretty much the same, but it also works when we have code that runs asynchronously. Your error handling mechanism shouldn't totally fall apart just because you make an HTTP request!\n"},"error_handling/maybe.html":{"url":"error_handling/maybe.html","title":"Maybe","keywords":"","body":"Maybe\nIt is best to just start with the definition of Maybe. It is a union type just like in all the examples here. It is defined like this:\n> type Maybe a = Nothing | Just a\n\n> Nothing\nNothing : Maybe a\n\n> Just\n : a -> Maybe a\n\n> Just \"hello\"\nJust \"hello\" : Maybe String\n\n> Just 1.618\nJust 1.618 : Maybe Float\n\nIf you want to have a Maybe value, you have to use the Nothing or Just constructors to create it. This means that to deal with the data, you have to use a case expression. This means the compiler can ensure that you have definitely covered both possibilities!\nThere are two major cases where you will see Maybe values.\nOptional Fields\nSay we are running a social networking website. Connecting people, friendship, etc. You know the spiel. The Onion outlined our real goals best: mine as much data as possible for the CIA. And if we want all the data, we need to ease people into it. Let them add it later. Add features that encourage them to share more and more information over time.\nSo let's start with a simple model of a user. They must have a name, but we are going to make the age optional.\ntype alias User =\n  { name : String\n  , age : Maybe Int\n  }\n\nNow say Sue logs in and decides not to provide her birthday:\nsue : User\nsue =\n  { name = \"Sue\", age = Nothing }\n\nNow her friends cannot wish her a happy birthday. Sad! Later Tom creates a profile and does give his age:\ntom : User\ntom =\n  { name = \"Tom\", age = Just 24 }\n\nGreat, that will be nice on his birthday. But more importantly, Tom is part of a valuable demographic! The advertisers will be pleased.\nAlright, so now that we have some users, how can we market alcohol to them without breaking any laws? People would probably be mad if we market to people under 21, so let's check for that:\ncanBuyAlcohol : User -> Bool\ncanBuyAlcohol user =\n  case user.age of\n    Nothing ->\n      False\n\n    Just age ->\n      age >= 21\n\nNow the cool thing is that we are forced to use a case to pattern match on the users age. It is actually impossible to write code where you forget that users may not have an age. Elm can make sure of it. Now we can advertise alcohol confident that we are not influencing minors directly! Only their older peers.\nPartial Functions\nSometimes you want a function that gives an answer sometimes, but just does not in other cases. \nLet's say Mountain Dew wants to do some ad buys for people ages 13 to 18. Honestly, it is better to start kids on Mountain Dew younger than that, but it is illegal for kids under 13 to be on our site.\nSo let's say we want to write a function that will tell us a user's age, but only if they are between 13 and 18:\ngetTeenAge : User -> Maybe Int\ngetTeenAge user =\n  case user.age of\n    Nothing ->\n      Nothing\n\n    Just age ->\n      if 13 \nAgain, we are reminded that users may not have an age, but if they do, we only want to return it if it is between 13 and 18. Now Elm can guarantee that anyone who calls getTeenAge will have to handle the possibility that the age is out of range.\nThis gets pretty cool when you start combining it with library functions like List.filterMap that help you process more data. For example, maybe we want to figure out the distribution of ages between 13 and 18. We could do it like this:\n> alice = User \"Alice\" (Just 14)\n... : User\n\n> bob = User \"Bob\" (Just 16)\n... : User\n\n> users = [ sue, tom, alice, bob ]\n... : List User\n\n> List.filterMap getTeenAge users\n[14,16] : List Int\n\nWe end up with only the ages we care about. Now we can feed our List Int into a function that figures out the distributions of each number.\n"},"error_handling/result.html":{"url":"error_handling/result.html","title":"Result","keywords":"","body":"Result\nA Result is useful when you have logic that may \"fail\". For example, parsing a String into an Int may fail. What if the string is filled with the letter B? In cases like this, we want a function with this type:\nString.toInt : String -> Result String Int\n\nThis means that String.toInt will take in a string value and start processing the string. If it cannot be turned into an integer, we provide a String error message. If it can be turned into an integer, we return that Int. So the Result String Int type is saying, \"my errors are strings and my successes are integers.\"\nTo make this as concrete as possible, let's see the actual definition of Result. It is actually pretty similar to the Maybe type, but it has two type variables:\ntype Result error value\n  = Err error\n  | Ok value\n\nYou have two constructors: Err to tag errors and Ok to tag successes. Let's see what happens when we actually use String.toInt in the REPL:\n> import String\n\n> String.toInt \"128\"\nOk 128 : Result String Int\n\n> String.toInt \"64\"\nOk 64 : Result String Int\n\n> String.toInt \"BBBB\"\nErr \"could not convert string 'BBBB' to an Int\" : Result String Int\n\nSo instead of throwing an exception like in most languages, we return data that indicates whether things have gone well or not. Let's imagine someone is typing their age into a text field and we want to show a validation message:\nview : String -> Html msg\nview userInputAge =\n  case String.toInt userInputAge of\n    Err msg ->\n      span [class \"error\"] [text msg]\n\n    Ok age ->\n      if age  140 then\n        span [class \"error\"] [text \"Seems unlikely...\"]\n\n      else\n        text \"OK!\"\n\nAgain, we have to use case so we are guaranteed to handle the special case where the number is bad.\n"},"error_handling/task.html":{"url":"error_handling/task.html","title":"Task","keywords":"","body":"Tasks\nThese docs are getting updated for 0.18. They will be back soon! Until then, the docs will give a partial overview.\n"},"interop/":{"url":"interop/","title":"Interop","keywords":"","body":"Interop\nInterop is extraordinarily important if you want your language to succeed!\nThis is just a historical fact. A huge part of why C++ was so successful was that it was easy to migrate a massive C codebase. If you look at the JVM, you see Scala and Clojure carving out pretty big niches for themselves thanks to their nice interop story with Java. For industrial users, there is no point in having an amazing language with great guarantees if there is no way to slowly introduce it into an existing codebase. It is exactly the same in browsers too.\nThis section focuses on the major kinds of interop that you need when working in browsers.\n\nHow to communicate with external services using JSON.\nHow to embed Elm programs in existing HTML or React apps.\nHow to communicate with existing JavaScript code.\n\nEach of these types of interop are guided by the self-imposed constraints that (1) there must be a clear way to introduce Elm gradually into diverse environments and (2) Elm should not have to sacrifice its core design principles. In other words, Elm should be great and it should be possible to use Elm at work.\nAdvice on Introducing Elm\nThe correct path is to first use Elm in a small experiment. If the experiment goes bad, stop it! If it goes great, expand the experiment a bit more. Then just repeat this process until you are using Elm or not! History seems to suggest that there is no realistic way to translate an existing project into a new language all at once. You have to evolve gradually!\nEvery company I know of that introduced Elm into an existing codebase did it gradually. You need to make sure it is worth it. You probably need to do some pairing or mentorship to get your teammates comfortable. You may even want to use React as a stepping stone if you are on something before that. Basically, anything you can do to minimize risk and make the process feel gradual will improve your odds. Now none of this is as fun as just switching, but it has the great benefit of actually working out in practice.\n"},"interop/json.html":{"url":"interop/json.html","title":"JSON","keywords":"","body":"\nThis section uses elm-repl. If you did not install it already, you can use the online REPL.\n\nJSON\nYou will be sending lots of JSON in your programs. You use the Json.Decode library to convert wild and crazy JSON into nicely structured Elm values.\nThe core concept for working with JSON is called a decoder. It decodes JSON values into Elm values. We will start out by looking at some very basic decoders and then look at how to put them together to handle more complex scenarios.\nPrimitive Decoders\nHere are the type signatures for a couple primitive decoders:\nstring : Decoder String\nint : Decoder Int\nfloat : Decoder Float\nbool : Decoder Bool\n\nThese become useful when paired with the decodeString function:\ndecodeString : Decoder a -> String -> Result String a\n\nThis means we can do stuff like this:\n> import Json.Decode exposing (..)\n\n> decodeString int \"42\"\nOk 42 : Result String Int\n\n> decodeString float \"3.14159\"\nOk 3.14159 : Result String Float\n\n> decodeString bool \"true\"\nOk True : Result String Bool\n\n> decodeString int \"true\"\nErr \"Expecting an Int but instead got: true\" : Result String Int\n\nSo our little decoders let us turn strings of JSON values into a Result telling us how the conversion went.\nNow that we can handle the simplest JSON values, how can we deal with more complex things like arrays and objects?\nCombining Decoders\nThe cool thing about decoders is that they snap together like building blocks. So if we want to handle a list of values, we would reach for the list function:\nlist : Decoder a -> Decoder (List a)\n\nWe can combine this with all the primitive decoders now:\n> import Json.Decode exposing (..)\n\n> int\n : Decoder Int\n\n> list int\n : Decoder (List Int)\n\n> decodeString (list int) \"[1,2,3]\"\nOk [1,2,3] : Result String (List Int)\n\n> decodeString (list string) \"\"\"[\"hi\", \"yo\"]\"\"\"\nOk [\"hi\", \"yo\"] : Result String (List String)\n\nSo now we can handle JSON arrays. If we want to get extra crazy, we can even nest lists.\n> decodeString (list (list int)) \"[ [0], [1,2,3], [4,5] ]\"\nOk [[0],[1,2,3],[4,5]] : Result String (List (List Int))\n\nSo that is list, but Json.Decode can handle many other data structures too. For example, dict helps you turn a JSON object into an Elm Dict and keyValuePairs helps you turn a JSON object into an Elm list of keys and values.\nDecoding Objects\nWe decode JSON objects with the field function. It snaps together decoders just like list:\nfield : String -> Decoder a -> Decoder a\n\nSo when you say field \"x\" int you are saying (1) I want a JSON object, (2) it should have a field x, and (3) the value at x should be an integer. So using it looks like this:\n> import Json.Decode exposing (..)\n\n> field \"x\" int\n : Decoder Int\n\n> decodeString (field \"x\" int) \"\"\"{ \"x\": 3, \"y\": 4 }\"\"\"\nOk 3 : Result String Int\n\n> decodeString (field \"y\" int) \"\"\"{ \"x\": 3, \"y\": 4 }\"\"\"\nOk 4 : Result String Int\n\nNotice that the field \"x\" int decoder only cares about field x. The object can have other fields with other content. That is all separate. But what happens when you want to get information from many fields? Well, we just need to put together many decoders. This is possible with functions like map2:\nmap2 : (a -> b -> value) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b -> Decoder value\n\nThis function takes in two different decoders. If they are both successful, it uses the given function to combine their results. So now we can put together two different decoders:\n> import Json.Decode exposing (..)\n\n> type alias Point = { x : Int, y : Int }\n\n> Point\n : Int -> Int -> Point\n\n> pointDecoder = map2 Point (field \"x\" int) (field \"y\" int)\n : Decoder Point\n\n> decodeString pointDecoder \"\"\"{ \"x\": 3, \"y\": 4 }\"\"\"\nOk { x = 3, y = 4 } : Result String Point\n\nOkay, that covers two fields, but what about three? Or four? The core library provides map3, map4, and others for handling larger objects.\nAs you start working with larger JSON objects, it is worth checking out NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline. It builds on top of the core Json.Decode module described here and lets you write stuff like this:\nimport Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, int)\nimport Json.Decode.Pipeline exposing (decode, required)\n\ntype alias Point = { x : Int, y : Int }\n\npointDecoder : Decoder Point\npointDecoder =\n  decode Point\n    |> required \"x\" int\n    |> required \"y\" int\n\nYou can have optional and hardcoded fields as well. It is quite a nice library, so take a look!\n\nBroader Context\nBy now you have seen a pretty big chunk of the actual Json.Decode API, so I want to give some additional context about how this fits into the broader world of Elm and web apps.\nValidating Server Data\nThe conversion from JSON to Elm doubles as a validation phase. You are not just converting from JSON, you are also making sure that JSON conforms to a particular structure.\nIn fact, decoders have revealed weird data coming from NoRedInk’s backend code! If your server is producing unexpected values for JavaScript, the client just gradually crashes as you run into missing fields. In contrast, Elm recognizes JSON values with unexpected structure, so NoRedInk gives a nice explanation to the user and logs the unexpected value. This has actually led to some patches in their Ruby server!\nA General Pattern\nJSON decoders are an example of a more general pattern in Elm. You see it whenever you want to wrap up complicated logic into small building blocks that snap together easily. Other examples include:\n\nRandom — The Random library has the concept of a Generator. So a Generator Int creates random integers. You start with primitive building blocks that generate random Int or Bool. From there, you use functions like list and map to build up generators for fancier types.\n\nEasing — The Easing library has the concept of an Interpolation. An Interpolation Float describes how to slide between two floating point numbers. You start with interpolations for primitives like Float or Color. The cool thing is that these interpolations compose, so you can build them up for much fancier types.\n\n\nAs of this writing, there is some early work on Protocol Buffers (binary data format) that uses the same pattern. In the end you get a nice composable API for converting between Elm values and binary!\n\n"},"interop/javascript.html":{"url":"interop/javascript.html","title":"JavaScript","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Interop\nAt some point your Elm program is probably going to need to talk to JavaScript. We do this by (1) embedding Elm in HTML and (2) sending messages back and forth between Elm and JavaScript:\n\nThis way we can have access to full power of JavaScript, the good and the bad, without giving up on all the things that are nice about Elm.\nStep 1: Embed in HTML\nNormally when you run the Elm compiler, it will give you an HTML file that sets everything up for you. So running this:\nelm-make src/Main.elm\n\nWill result in a index.html file that you can just open up and start using. To do fancier stuff, we want to compile to JavaScript, so we modify the command slightly:\nelm-make src/Main.elm --output=main.js\n\nNow the compiler will generate a JavaScript file that lets you initialize your program like this:\n\n\n\n    var node = document.getElementById('main');\n    var app = Elm.Main.embed(node);\n    // Note: if your Elm module is named \"MyThing.Root\" you\n    // would call \"Elm.MyThing.Root.embed(node)\" instead.\n\n\nThis is doing three important things:\n\nWe create a  that will hold the Elm program.\nWe load the JavaScript generated by the Elm compiler.\nWe grab the relevant node and initialize our Elm program in it.\n\nSo now we can set Elm up in any  we want. So if you are using React, you can create a component that just sets this kind of thing up. If you are using Angular or Ember or something else, it should not be too crazy either. Just take over a .\nThe next section gets into how to get your Elm and JavaScript code to communicate with each other in a nice way.\nStep 2: Talk to JavaScript\nThere are two major ways for Elm and JavaScript to talk to each other: ports and flags.\nPorts\nSay we have a nice Elm program and everything is going fine, but we want to use some JavaScript spell-checking library to get a feature done real quick. The final result is shown here, and we will walk through the most important parts here.\nOkay, in Elm, any communication with JavaScript goes through a port. Think of it like a hole in the side of your Elm program where you can send values in and out. These work exactly like the commands and subscriptions from the Architecture section. Sending values out to JS is a command. Listening for values coming in from JS is a subscription. Pretty neat!\nSo if we want to talk to this spell-checking library, our Elm program will need these additional declarations:\nport module Spelling exposing (..)\n\n...\n\n-- port for sending strings out to JavaScript\nport check : String -> Cmd msg\n\n-- port for listening for suggestions from JavaScript\nport suggestions : (List String -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\n...\n\nAgain, you can see the whole file here, but these are the important additions:\n\nWe change the module declaration to port module. This indicates that port declarations should be permitted. (Very few modules should have ports in them!)\n\nWe create a check port. On the Elm side, we can create commands like check \"badger\", resulting in a Cmd msg that sends strings to the JS side.\n\nWe create a suggestions port. This one looks a bit fancier than the check port, but imagine that it is creating Sub (List String). You are essentially subscribing to lists of strings sent into Elm from JS. So when the spell-checking library has a suggestion, it will send things through. Now, the type of suggestions is a bit fancier than that. You provide a function from (List String -> msg) so you can convert that list of strings to your Msg type immediately. This makes it easy to deal with in your update function, but it is just for convenience. The real point is to send a List String from JS into Elm.\n\n\nOkay, so after you run elm-make Spelling.elm --output=spelling.js you embed it in HTML like this:\n\n\n\n    var app = Elm.Spelling.fullscreen();\n\n    app.ports.check.subscribe(function(word) {\n        var suggestions = spellCheck(word);\n        app.ports.suggestions.send(suggestions);\n    });\n\n    function spellCheck(word) {\n        // have a real implementation!\n        return [];\n    }\n\n\nOkay, so all the ports you declare in your Elm program will be available as fields of app.ports. In the code above, we access app.ports.check and app.ports.suggestions. They work like this:\n\nWe can subscribe to app.ports.check. Every time Elm says to send a value out, we will call this JavaScript function.\n\nWe can send values to app.ports.suggestions. So whenever we have some new suggestions for Elm, we just send them through.\n\n\nWith that knowledge, we can communicate back and forth with JavaScript!\n\nNote: Elm validates all values coming in from JavaScript. In Elm we said we can only handle List String so we need to make sure that the JavaScript code does not break that contract! More about that farther down this page.\n\nFlags\nThe second way to talk to JavaScript is with flags. You can think of this as some static configuration for your Elm program.\nInstead of creating a Program with the program function, we can use the programWithFlags. So say we want to get a value like this from JavaScript on initialization:\ntype alias Flags =\n  { user : String\n  , token : String\n  }\n\nWe would set up our Elm program like this:\ninit : Flags -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit flags =\n  ...\n\nmain =\n  programWithFlags { init = init, ... }\n\nAnd on the JavaScript side, we start the program like this:\n// if you want it to be fullscreen\nvar app = Elm.MyApp.fullscreen({\n    user: 'Tom',\n    token: '12345'\n});\n\n// if you want to embed your app\nvar node = document.getElementById('my-app');\nvar app = Elm.MyApp.embed(node, {\n    user: 'Tom',\n    token: '12345'\n});\n\nNotice that this is exactly the same as normal, but we provide an extra argument with all the flags we want.\nJust like ports, the values sent in from JavaScript are validated to make sure JavaScript bugs stay in JavaScript.\nCustoms and Border Protection\nPorts and flags must be careful about what values are allowed through. Elm is statically typed, so each port is fitted with some border protection code that ensures that type errors are kept out. Ports also do some conversions so that you get nice colloquial data structures in both Elm and JS.\nThe particular types that can be sent in and out of ports are quite flexible, covering all valid JSON values. Specifically, incoming ports can handle all the following Elm types:\n\nBooleans and Strings – both exist in Elm and JS!\nNumbers – Elm ints and floats correspond to JS numbers\nLists   – correspond to JS arrays\nArrays  – correspond to JS arrays\nTuples  – correspond to fixed-length, mixed-type JS arrays\nRecords – correspond to JavaScript objects\nMaybes  – Nothing and Just 42 correspond to null and 42 in JS\nJson    – Json.Encode.Value corresponds to arbitrary JSON\n\nNow say Elm wants a List String, but someone calls app.ports.suggestions.send(42) on the JavaScript side. We know it will cause issues in Elm, and we know the code producing invalid data is on the JS side. So rather than letting the bad data into Elm and cause a runtime exception eventually (the JavaScript way!) we throw a runtime exception immediately when you call send with invalid data. So we cannot solve the problem of invalid data in JavaScript, but we can at least make sure it stays on the JavaScript side!\nUsage Advice\nI showed an example where the ports were declared in the root module. This is not a strict requirement. You can actually create a port module that gets imported by various parts of your app.\nIt seems like it is probably best to just have one port module for your project so it is easier to figure out the API on the JavaScript side. I plan to improve tooling such that you can just ask though.\n\nNote: Port modules are not permitted in the package repository. Imagine you download an Elm package and it just doesn't work. You read the docs and discover you also need to get some JS code and hook it up properly. Lame. Bad experience. Now imagine if you had this risk with every package out there. It just would feel crappy, so we do not allow that.\n\nHistorical Context\nNow I know that this is not the typical interpretation of language interop. Usually languages just go for full backwards compatibility. So C code can be used anywhere in C++ code. You can replace C/C++ with Java/Scala or JavaScript/TypeScript. This is the easiest solution, but it forces you to make quite extreme sacrifices in the new language. All the problems of the old language now exist in the new one too. Hopefully less though.\nElm's interop is built on the observation that by enforcing some architectural rules, you can make full use of the old language without making sacrifices in the new one. This means we can keep making guarantees like \"you will not see runtime errors in Elm\" even as you start introducing whatever crazy JavaScript code you need.\nSo what are these architectural rules? Turns out it is just The Elm Architecture. Instead of embedding arbitrary JS code right in the middle of Elm, we use commands and subscriptions to send messages to external JavaScript code. So just like how the WebSocket library insulates you from all the crazy failures that might happen with web sockets, port modules insulate you from all the crazy failures that might happen in JavaScript. It is like JavaScript-as-a-Service.\n"},"reuse/":{"url":"reuse/","title":"Scaling The Elm Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Scaling The Elm Architecture\nIf you are coming from JavaScript, you are probably wondering “where are my reusable components?” and “how do I do parent-child communication between them?” A great deal of time and effort is spent on these questions in JavaScript, but it just works different in Elm. We do not think in terms of reusable components. Instead, we focus on reusable functions. It is a functional language after all!\nSo this chapter will go through a few examples that show how we create reusable views by breaking out helper functions to display our data. We will also learn about Elm’s module system which helps you break your code into multiple files and hide implementation details. These are the core tools and techniques of building large app with Elm.\nIn the end, I think we end up with something far more flexible and reliable than “reusable components” and there is no real trick. We will just be using the fundamental tools of functional programming!\n"},"reuse/checkboxes.html":{"url":"reuse/checkboxes.html","title":"Labeled Checkboxes","keywords":"","body":"Labeled Checkboxes\nYour app will probably have some options people can mess with. If something happens, should you send them an email notification? If they come across a video, should it start playing by itself? That kind of thing. So you will need to create some HTML like this:\n\n  Email Notifications\n  Video Autoplay\n  Use Location\n\n\nThat will let people toggle the checkboxes, and using  means they get a much bigger area they can click on. Let’s write an Elm program that manages all this interaction! As always, we will take a guess at our Model. We know we need to track the user’s settings so we will put them in our model:\ntype alias Model =\n  { notifications : Bool\n  , autoplay : Bool\n  , location : Bool\n  }\n\nFrom there, we will want to figure out our messages and update function. Maybe something like this:\ntype Msg\n  = ToggleNotifications\n  | ToggleAutoplay\n  | ToggleLocation\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    ToggleNotifications ->\n      { model | notifications = not model.notifications }\n\n    ToggleAutoplay ->\n      { model | autoplay = not model.autoplay }\n\n    ToggleLocation ->\n      { model | location = not model.location }\n\nThat seems fine. Now to create our view!\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  fieldset []\n    [ label []\n        [ input [ type_ \"checkbox\", onClick ToggleNotifications ] []\n        , text \"Email Notifications\"\n        ]\n    , label []\n        [ input [ type_ \"checkbox\", onClick ToggleAutoplay ] []\n        , text \"Video Autoplay\"\n        ]\n    , label []\n        [ input [ type_ \"checkbox\", onClick ToggleLocation ] []\n        , text \"Use Location\"\n        ]\n    ]\n\nThis is not too crazy, but we are repeating ourselves quite a bit. How can we make our view function nicer? If you are coming from JavaScript, your first instinct is probably that we should make a “labeled checkbox component” but your first instinct is wrong! Instead, we will create a helper function!\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  fieldset []\n    [ checkbox ToggleNotifications \"Email Notifications\"\n    , checkbox ToggleAutoplay \"Video Autoplay\"\n    , checkbox ToggleLocation \"Use Location\"\n    ]\n\ncheckbox : msg -> String -> Html msg\ncheckbox msg name =\n  label []\n    [ input [ type_ \"checkbox\", onClick msg ] []\n    , text name\n    ]\n\nNow we have a highly configurable checkbox function. It takes two arguments to configure how it works: the message it produces on clicks and some text to show next to the checkbox. Now if we decide we want all checkboxes to have a certain class, we just add it in the checkbox function and it shows up everywhere! This is the essense of reusable views in Elm. Create helper functions!\nComparing Reusable Views to Reusable Components\nWe now have enough information to do a simple comparison of these approaches. Reusable views have a few major advantages over components:\n\nIt is just functions. We are not doing anything special here. Functions have all the power we need, and they are very simple to create. It is the most basic building block of Elm!\n\nNo parent-child communication. If we had made a “checkbox component” we would have to figure out how to synchronize the state in the checkbox component with our overall model. “That checkbox says notifications are on, but the model says they are off!” Maybe we need a Flux store now? By using functions instead, we are able to have reuse in our view without disrupting our Model or update. They work exactly the same as before, no need to touch them!\n\n\nThis means we can always create reusable view code without changing our overall architecture or introducing any fancy ideas. Just write smaller functions. That sounds nice, but let’s see some more examples to make sure it is true!\n"},"reuse/radio_buttons.html":{"url":"reuse/radio_buttons.html","title":"Radio Buttons","keywords":"","body":"Radio Buttons\nSay you have a website that is primarily about reading, like this guide! You may want to have a way to choose between small, medium, and large fonts so your readers can customize it for their preferences. In that case, you will want some HTML like this:\n\n  Small\n  Medium\n  Large\n\n\nJust like in the checkbox example from the previous page, this will let people choose the one they want, and using  means they get a much bigger area they can click on. Like always, we start with our Model. This one is kind of interesting because we can use union types to make it very reliable!\ntype alias Model =\n  { fontSize : FontSize\n  , content : String\n  }\n\ntype FontSize = Small | Medium | Large\n\nThis means there are exactly three possible font sizes: Small, Medium, and Large. It is impossible to have any other value in our fontSize field. If you are coming from JavaScript, you know their alternative is to use strings or numbers and just hope that there is never a typo or mistake. You could use values like that in Elm, but why open yourself up to bugs for no reason?!\n\nNote: You should always be looking for opportunities to use union types in your data. The best way to avoid invalid states is to make them impossible to represent in the first place!\n\nAlright, now we need to update our model. In this case we just want to switch between font sizes as the user toggles the radio buttons:\ntype Msg\n  = SwitchTo FontSize\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n  case msg of\n    SwitchTo newFontSize ->\n      { model | fontSize = newFontSize }\n\nNow we need to describe how to show our Model on screen. First let’s see the one where we put all our code in one function and repeat ourselves a bunch of times:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ fieldset []\n        [ label []\n            [ input [ type_ \"radio\", onClick (SwitchTo Small) ] []\n            , text \"Small\"\n            ]\n        , label []\n            [ input [ type_ \"radio\", onClick (SwitchTo Medium) ] []\n            , text \"Medium\"\n            ]\n        , label []\n            [ input [ type_ \"radio\", onClick (SwitchTo Large) ] []\n            , text \"Large\"\n            ]\n        ]\n    , section [] [ text model.content ]\n    ]\n\nThat is kind of a mess! The best thing to do is to start making helper functions (not components!). We see some repetition in the radio buttons, so we will start there.\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ fieldset []\n        [ radio (SwitchTo Small) \"Small\"\n        , radio (SwitchTo Medium) \"Medium\"\n        , radio (SwitchTo Large) \"Large\"\n        ]\n    , section [] [ text model.content ]\n    ]\n\nradio : msg -> String -> Html msg\nradio msg name =\n  label []\n    [ input [ type_ \"radio\", onClick msg ] []\n    , text name\n    ]\n\nOur view function is quite a bit easier to read now. Great!\nIf that is the only chunk of radio buttons on your page, you are done. But perhaps you have a couple sets of radio buttons. For example, this guide not only lets you set font size, but also color scheme and whether you use a serif or sans-serif font. Each of those can be implemented as a set of radio buttons, so we could do a bit more refactoring, like this:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n  div []\n    [ viewPicker\n        [ (\"Small\", SwitchTo Small)\n        , (\"Medium\", SwitchTo Medium)\n        , (\"Large\", SwitchTo Large)\n        ]\n    , section [] [ text model.content ]\n    ]\n\nviewPicker : List (String, msg) -> Html msg\nviewPicker options =\n  fieldset [] (List.map radio options)\n\nradio : (String, msg) -> Html msg\nradio (name, msg) =\n  label []\n    [ input [ type_ \"radio\", onClick msg ] []\n    , text name\n    ]\n\nSo if we want to let users choose a color scheme or toggle serifs, the view can reuse viewPicker for each case. If we do that, we may want to add additional arguments to the viewPicker function. If we want to be able to set a class on each , we could add an argument like this:\nviewPicker : String -> List (String, msg) -> Html msg\nviewPicker pickerClass options =\n  fieldset [ class pickerClass ] (List.map radio options)\n\nOr if we wanted even more flexibility, we could let people pass in whatever attributes they please, like this:\nviewPicker : List (Attribute msg) -> List (String, msg) -> Html msg\nviewPicker attributes options =\n  fieldset attributes (List.map radio options)\n\nAnd if we wanted even MORE flexibility, we could let people pass in attributes for each radio button too! There is really no end to what can be configured. You just add a bit more information to an argument.\nToo Much Reuse?\nIn this case, we saw quite a few ways to write the same code. But which way is the right way to do it? A good rule to pick an API is choose the absolute simplest thing that does everything you need. Here are some scenarios that test this rule:\n\nThere is the only radio button thing on your page. In that case, just make them! Do not worry about making a highly configurable and reusable function for radio buttons. Refactoring is easy in Elm, so wait for a legitimate need before doing that work!\n\nThere are a couple radio button things on your page, all with the same styling. That is how the options on this guide look. This is a great case for sharing a view function. You may not even need to change any classes or add any custom attributes. If you do not need that, do not design for it! It is easy to add later.\n\nThere are a couple radio button things on your page, but they are very different. You could do an extremely flexible picker that lets you configure everything, but at some point, things that look similar are not actually similar enough for this to be worth it. So if you ever find yourself with tons of complex arguments configuring a view function, you may have overdone it on the reuse. I personally would prefer to have two chunks of similar view code that are both simple and easy to change than one chunk of view code that is complex and hard to understand.\n\n\nPoint is, there is no magic recipe here. The answer will depend on the particulars of your application, and you should always try to find the simplest approach. Sometimes that means sharing code. Sometimes it means writing similar code. It takes practice and experience to get good at this, so do not be afraid to experiment to find simpler ways!\n"},"reuse/modules.html":{"url":"reuse/modules.html","title":"Modules","keywords":"","body":"Modules\nIn the last few sections, we learned how to create reusable views. Whenever you start seeing a pattern in your view code, you can break it out into a helper function. But so far, we have just been growing our files longer and longer. At some point this gets out of control though, we do not want to have 2000 line files!\nSo Elm has modules to help you grow your codebase in a nice way. On the most basic level, modules let you break your code into multiple files. Like everything else in Elm, you should only reach for a fancier tool when you feel you need it. So if you have a 400 line file and notice that a bunch of code is all related to showing radio buttons in a certain way, it may be a good idea to move all the relevant functions and types into their own module.\nBefore we get into the nuances of using modules appropriately, let’s learn how to use them at all!\nDefining Modules\nEvery module starts with a module declaration. So if I wanted to define my own version of the Maybe module, I might start with something like this:\nmodule Optional exposing (..)\n\ntype Optional a = Some a | None\n\nisNone : Optional a -> Bool\nisNone optional =\n  case optional of\n    Some _ ->\n      False\n\n    None ->\n      True\n\nThe new thing here is that first line. You can read it as “This module is named Optional and it exposes everything to people who use the module.”\nExposing everything is fine for prototyping and exploration, but a serious project will want to make the exposed values explicit, like this:\nmodule Optional exposing ( Optional(..), isNone )\n\nRead this as “This module is named Optional and it exposes the Optional type, the Some and None constructors, and the isNone function to people who use the module.” Now there is no reason to list everything that is defined, so later we will see how this can be used to hide implementation details.\n\nNote: If you forget to add a module declaration, Elm will use this one instead:\nmodule Main exposing (..)\n\nThis makes things easier for beginners working in just one file. They should not be confronted with the module system on their first day!\n\nUsing Modules\nOkay, we have our Optional module, but how do we use it? We can create import declarations at the top of files that describe which modules are needed. So if we wanted to make the “No shoes, no shirt, no service” policy explicit in code, we could write this:\nimport Optional\n\nnoService : Optional.Optional a -> Optional.Optional a -> Bool\nnoService shoes shirt =\n  Optional.isNone shoes && Optional.isNone shirt\n\nThe import Optional line means you can use anything exposed by the module as long as you put Optional. before it. So in the noService function, you see Optional.Optional and Optional.isNone. These are called qualified names. Which isNone is it? The one from the Optional module! It says it right there in the code.\nGenerally, it is best to always use qualified names. In a project with twenty imports, it is extremely helpful to be able to quickly see where a value comes from.\nThat said, there are a few ways to customize an import that can come in handy.\nAs\nYou can use the as keyword to provide a shorter name. To stick with the Optional module, we could abbreviate it to just Opt like this:\nimport Optional as Opt\n\nnoService : Opt.Optional a -> Opt.Optional a -> Bool\nnoService shoes shirt =\n  Opt.isNone shoes && Opt.isNone shirt\n\nNow we can refer to Opt.Optional and Opt.isNone. It is kind of nice in this case, but this feature is best used on very long module names. Cases like this:\nimport Facebook.News.Story as Story\n\nIt would be annoying to type out the whole module name every time we need a function from it, so we shorten it to a name that is clear and helpful.\nExposing\nYou can also use the exposing keyword to bring in the contents of the module without a qualifier. You will sometimes see things like this:\nimport Optional exposing (Optional)\n\nnoService : Optional a -> Optional a -> Bool\nnoService shoes shirt =\n  Optional.isNone shoes && Optional.isNone shirt\n\nThis way you can refer to the Optional type directly, but still need to say Optional.isNone and Optional.None for everything else exposed by the module.\nThis exposing keyword works just like it does in module declarations. If you want to expose everything you use exposing (..). If you want to expose everything explicitly, you would say exposing ( Optional(..), isNone ).\nMixing Both\nIt is possible to use as and exposing together. You could write:\nimport Optional as Opt exposing (Optional)\n\nnoService : Optional a -> Optional a -> Bool\nnoService shoes shirt =\n  Opt.isNone shoes && Opt.isNone shirt\n\nNo matter how you choose to import a module, you will only be able to refer to types and values that the module has made publicly available. You may get to see only one function from a module that has twenty. That is up to the author of the module!\nBuilding Projects with Multiple Modules\nWe know what the Elm code looks like now, but how do we get elm-make to recognize our modules?\nEvery Elm project has an elm-package.json file at its root. It will look something like this:\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"summary\": \"helpful summary of your project, less than 80 characters\",\n    \"repository\": \"https://github.com/user/project.git\",\n    \"license\": \"BSD3\",\n    \"source-directories\": [\n        \"src\",\n        \"benchmarks/src\"\n    ],\n    \"exposed-modules\": [],\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"elm-lang/core\": \"4.0.2 \nThere are two important parts for us:\n\n\"source-directories\" — This is a list of all the directories that elm-make will search through to find modules. Saying import Optional means elm-make will search for src/Optional.elm and benchmarks/src/Optional.elm. Notice that the name of the module needs to match the name of the file exactly.\n\n\"dependencies\" — This lists all the community packages you depend on. Saying import Optional means elm-make will also search the elm-lang/core and elm-lang/html packages for modules named Optional.\n\n\nTypically, you will say \"source-directories\": [ \"src\" ] and have your project set up like this:\nmy-project/elm-package.json\nmy-project/src/Main.elm\nmy-project/src/Optional.elm\nAnd when you want to compile your Main.elm file, you say:\ncd my-project\nelm-make src/Main.elm\n\nWith this setup, elm-make will know exactly where to find the Optional module.\n\nNote: If you want fancier directory structure for your Elm code, you can use module names like Facebook.Feed.Story. That module would need to live in a file at Facebook/Feed/Story.elm so that the file name matches the module name.\n\n"},"reuse/more.html":{"url":"reuse/more.html","title":"More","keywords":"","body":"More\nRight now this section gives a brief introduction to reusable views. Instead of thinking about components, you create simple functions and configure them by passing in arguments. You can see the most extreme versions of this by checking out the following projects:\n\nevancz/elm-sortable-table\nthebritican/elm-autocomplete\n\nThe README of elm-sortable-table has some nice guidance on how to use APIs like these and why they are designed as they are. You can also watch the API design session where Greg and I figured out an API for elm-autocomplete here:\n\nWe talk through a lot of the design considerations that go into APIs like these. One big takeaway is that you should not expect to do something as elaborate as this for every single thing in your app! As of this writing, NoRedInk has more than 30k lines of Elm and one or two instances where they felt it made sense to design something as elaborate as this.\nHopefully those resources help guide you as you make larger and larger programs!\n\nNote: I plan to fill this section in with more examples of growing your Model and update functions. It is roughly the same ideas though. If you find yourself repeating yourself, maybe break things out. If a function gets too big, make a helper function. If you see related things, maybe move them to a module. But at the end of the day, it is not a huge deal if you let things get big. Elm is great at finding problems and making refactors easy, so it is not actually a huge deal if you have a bunch of entries in your Model because it does not seem better to break them out in some way. I will be writing more about this!\n\n"}}}
