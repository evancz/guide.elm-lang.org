# Installation

We have come a long way without installing anything! We learned **The Elm Architecture**. We learned about **types**. We learned how to interact with the outside world through **commands** and **subscriptions**. Things are going well, but we need to get Elm working on your computer for the next couple sections!

The next two pages will show how to get Elm working in your **editor** and then in your **terminal**.


**Why?** Upcoming topics like "JavaScript Interop" work a lot better when you can save files locally on your computer. This will also set us up to create more complex personal projects!

**Troubleshooting:** Things can sometimes go wrong with installation, so if you run into any trouble, please ask about it in a [community forum](https://elm-lang.org/community)! Talking through an install problem can usually save you a lot of time, and people are happy to help out. Please ask for help!
