# JSON

We just saw an example that uses HTTP to get the content of a book. That is great, but a ton of servers return data in a special format called JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON for short.

So our next example shows how to fetch some JSON data, allowing us to press a button to show random quotes from a haphazard selection of books. Click the blue "Edit" button and look through the program a bit. Maybe you have read some of these books too? **Click the blue button now!**

<div class="edit-link"><a href="https://elm-lang.org/examples/quotes">Edit</a></div>

```elm
import Browser
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (style)
import Html.Events exposing (..)
import Http
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, map4, field, int, string)



-- MAIN


main =
  Browser.element
    { init = init
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    , view = view
    }



-- MODEL


type Model
  = Failure
  | Loading
  | Success Quote


type alias Quote =
  { quote : String
  , source : String
  , author : String
  , year : Int
  }


init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init _ =
  (Loading, getRandomQuote)



-- UPDATE


type Msg
  = MorePlease
  | GotQuote (Result Http.Error Quote)


update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    MorePlease ->
      (Loading, getRandomQuote)

    GotQuote result ->
      case result of
        Ok quote ->
          (Success quote, Cmd.none)

        Err _ ->
          (Failure, Cmd.none)



-- SUBSCRIPTIONS


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Sub.none



-- VIEW


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ h2 [] [ text "Random Quotes" ]
    , viewQuote model
    ]


viewQuote : Model -> Html Msg
viewQuote model =
  case model of
    Failure ->
      div []
        [ text "I could not load a random quote for some reason. "
        , button [ onClick MorePlease ] [ text "Try Again!" ]
        ]

    Loading ->
      text "Loading..."

    Success quote ->
      div []
        [ button [ onClick MorePlease, style "display" "block" ] [ text "More Please!" ]
        , blockquote [] [ text quote.quote ]
        , p [ style "text-align" "right" ]
            [ text "â€” "
            , cite [] [ text quote.source ]
            , text (" by " ++ quote.author ++ " (" ++ String.fromInt quote.year ++ ")")
            ]
        ]



-- HTTP


getRandomQuote : Cmd Msg
getRandomQuote =
  Http.get
    { url = "https://elm-lang.org/api/random-quotes"
    , expect = Http.expectJson GotQuote quoteDecoder
    }


quoteDecoder : Decoder Quote
quoteDecoder =
  map4 Quote
    (field "quote" string)
    (field "source" string)
    (field "author" string)
    (field "year" int)
```

This example is pretty similar to the last one:

- `init` starts us off in the `Loading` state, with a command to get a random quote.
- `update` handles the `GotQuote` message for whenever a new quote is available. Whatever happens there, we do not have any additional commands. It also handles the `MorePlease` message when someone presses the button, issuing a command to get more random quotes.
- `view` shows you the quotes!

The main difference is in the `getRandomQuote` definition. Instead of using `Http.expectString`, we have switched to `Http.expectJson`. What is the deal with that?

## JSON

When you ask [`/api/random-quotes`](https://elm-lang.org/api/random-quotes) for a random quote, the server produces a string of JSON like this:

```json
{
  "quote": "December used to be a month but it is now a year",
  "source": "Letters from a Stoic",
  "author": "Seneca",
  "year": 54
}
```

We have no guarantees about any of the information here. The server can change the names of fields, and the fields may have different types in different situations. It is a wild world!

In JavaScript, the approach is to just turn JSON into JavaScript objects and hope nothing goes wrong. But if there is some typo or unexpected data, you get a runtime exception somewhere in your code. Was the code wrong? Was the data wrong? It is time to start digging around to find out!

In Elm, we validate the JSON before it comes into our program. So if the data has an unexpected structure, we learn about it immediately. There is no way for bad data to sneak through and cause a runtime exception three files over. This is accomplished with JSON decoders.

## JSON Decoders

Say we have some JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Tom",
  "age": 42
}
```

We need to run it through a `Decoder` to access specific information. So if we wanted to get the `"age"`, we would run the JSON through a `Decoder Int` that describes exactly how to access that information:

![](diagrams/int.svg)

If all goes well, we get an `Int` on the other side! And if we wanted the `"name"` we would run the JSON through a `Decoder String` that describes exactly how to access it:

![](diagrams/string.svg)

If all goes well, we get a `String` on the other side!

How do we create decoders like this though?

## Building Blocks

The [`elm/json`][json] package gives us the [`Json.Decode`][decode] module. It is filled with tiny decoders that we can snap together.

[json]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/
[decode]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode

So to get `"age"` from `{ "name": "Tom", "age": 42 }` we would create a decoder like this:

```elm
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, int)

ageDecoder : Decoder Int
ageDecoder =
  field "age" int

 -- int : Decoder Int
 -- field : String -> Decoder a -> Decoder a
```

The [`field`][field] function takes two arguments:

1. `String` &mdash; a field name. So we are demanding an object with an `"age"` field.
2. `Decoder a` &mdash; a decoder to try next. So if the `"age"` field exists, we will try this decoder on the value there.

So putting it together, `field "age" int` is asking for an `"age"` field, and if it exists, it runs the `Decoder Int` to try to extract an integer.

We do pretty much exactly the same thing to extract the `"name"` field:

```elm
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, string)

nameDecoder : Decoder String
nameDecoder =
  field "name" string

-- string : Decoder String
```

In this case we demand an object with a `"name"` field, and if it exists, we want the value there to be a `String`.

[field]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#field

## Combining Decoders

But what if we want to decode _two_ fields? We snap decoders together with [`map2`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#map2):

```elm
map2 : (a -> b -> value) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b -> Decoder value
```

This function takes in two decoders. It tries them both and combines their results. So now we can put together two different decoders:

```elm
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, map2, field, string, int)

type alias Person =
  { name : String
  , age : Int
  }

personDecoder : Decoder Person
personDecoder =
  map2 Person
  	(field "name" string)
  	(field "age" int)
```

So if we used `personDecoder` on `{ "name": "Tom", "age": 42 }` we would get out an Elm value like `Person "Tom" 42`.

If we really wanted to get into the spirit of decoders, we would define `personDecoder` as `map2 Person nameDecoder ageDecoder` using our previous definitions. You always want to be building your decoders up from smaller building blocks!

## Nesting Decoders

A lot of JSON data is not so nice and flat. Imagine if `/api/random-quotes/v2` was released with richer information about authors:

```json
{
  "quote": "December used to be a month but it is now a year",
  "source": "Letters from a Stoic",
  "author": {
    "name": "Seneca",
    "age": 68,
    "origin": "Cordoba"
  },
  "year": 54
}
```

We could handle this new scenario by nesting our nice little decoders:

```elm
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, map2, map4, field, int, string)

type alias Quote =
  { quote : String
  , source : String
  , author : Person
  , year : Int
  }

quoteDecoder : Decoder Quote
quoteDecoder =
  map4 Quote
    (field "quote" string)
    (field "source" string)
    (field "author" personDecoder)
    (field "year" int)

type alias Person =
  { name : String
  , age : Int
  }

personDecoder : Decoder Person
personDecoder =
  map2 Person
    (field "name" string)
    (field "age" int)
```

Notice that we do not bother decoding the `"origin"` field of the author. Decoders are fine with skipping over fields, which can be helpful when extracting a small amount of information from very large JSON values.

## Next Steps

There are a bunch of important functions in `Json.Decode` that we did not cover here:

- [`bool`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#bool) : `Decoder Bool`
- [`list`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#list) : `Decoder a -> Decoder (List a)`
- [`dict`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#dict) : `Decoder a -> Decoder (Dict String a)`
- [`oneOf`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#oneOf) : `List (Decoder a) -> Decoder a`

So there are ways to extract all sorts of data structures. The `oneOf` function is particularly helpful for messy JSON. (e.g. sometimes you get an `Int` and other times you get a `String` containing digits. So annoying!)

We saw [`map2`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#map2) and [`map4`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#map4) for handling objects with many fields. But as you start working with larger and larger JSON objects, it is worth checking out [`NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest). The types there are a bit fancier, but some folks find them much easier to read and work with.

> **Fun Fact:** I have heard a bunch of stories of folks finding bugs in their _server_ code as they switched from JS to Elm. The decoders people write end up working as a validation phase, catching weird stuff in JSON values. So when NoRedInk switched from React to Elm, it revealed a couple bugs in their Ruby code!
