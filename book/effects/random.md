We are going to make an app that rolls dice, producing a random number between 1 and 6.

We need the [`elm/random`][readme] package for this. The [`Random`][random] module in particular. Let&rsquo;s start by just looking at all the code. There are some new things, but do not worry. We will go through it all!

[readme]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest
[random]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/Random

```elm
import Browser
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (..)
import Random



-- MAIN


main =
  Browser.element
    { init = init
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    , view = view
    }



-- MODEL


type alias Model =
  { dieFace : Int
  }


init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init _ =
  ( Model 1
  , Cmd.none
  )



-- UPDATE


type Msg
  = Roll
  | NewFace Int


update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Roll ->
      ( model
      , Random.generate NewFace (Random.int 1 6)
      )

    NewFace newFace ->
      ( Model newFace
      , Cmd.none
      )



-- SUBSCRIPTIONS


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Sub.none



-- VIEW


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ h1 [] [ text (String.fromInt model.dieFace) ]
    , button [ onClick Roll ] [ text "Roll" ]
    ]
```

Now there are a couple new things in this program. Let&rsquo;s work through them!


## `update`

In the previous examples, the `update` function just produced a new `Model`. The new code is doing a bit more:

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Roll ->
      ( model
      , Random.generate NewFace (Random.int 1 6)
      )

    NewFace newFace ->
      ( Model newFace
      , Cmd.none
      )
```

Say this `update` function gets a `Roll` message. It is going to produce two values:

1. The `model` without any changes.
2. A **command** to generate a random integer between `1` and `6`.

These both go to Elm&rsquo;s runtime system:

![](diagrams/element.svg)

The runtime system (RTS) will handle these two values as follows:

1. When the RTS gets a new `Model`, it calls your `view` function. Does the DOM need to change? In this case, it does not!
2. When the RTS gets a command, it immediately starts working on it. In this case, the RTS generates a random number and sends a message like `NewFace 3` or `NewFace 5` back to our `update` function. So `Cmd Msg` is saying &ldquo;this is a command for the RTS, and the RTS will give us back a `Msg` about what happened.&rdquo;

Let&rsquo;s say the command produces a `NewFace 3` message. That triggers the second branch of our `update` function. In this case, we update our `Model` with the new value and give [`Cmd.none`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform-Cmd#none) to indicate that we have no commands this time.

> **Note:** One crucial detail here is that **commands are data**. So just because you create a command does not mean it is happening. Here are some analogies:
>
> - Maybe you find a cake recipe (command) on the internet. It outlines exactly how to make a delicious cake. You have to give it to a baker (RTS) to actually turn it into a cake.
> - Maybe you have a grocery list (command) on your fridge. You need a sack of potatoes. You can only get those potatoes if you (RTS) go to the store and buy them.
> - Maybe I tell you to eat an entire watermelon in one bite (command) right this second. Did you do it? No! You (RTS) kept reading before you even *thought* about buying a tiny watermelon.
>
> None of these analogies are perfect, particularly because the Elm runtime system is much more reliable than you or a baker! When you give it a command, it starts working on it immediately and it follows your directions exactly.


## `init`

In previous examples, `init` was a value specifying the initial `Model` for our Elm program. In our new version, it is a function:

```elm
init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init _ =
  ( Model 1
  , Cmd.none
  )
```

Like our new `update` function, we are now producing (1) a new model and (2) some commands for the RTS. In our dice rolling program, we give `Cmd.none` because we do not need to do anything on initialization, but later you may want to do things like trigger HTTP requests from here.

> **Note:** Why is it taking that `()` argument though? We are just ignoring it. What is the point? Well, this program switches from [`Browser.sandbox`][sandbox] to [`Browser.element`][element], enabling the command features we have been looking at so far. It _also_ allows the program to get &ldquo;flags&rdquo; from JavaScript on initialization. So the `()` is saying that we are not getting any interesting flags. We will talk about this more in the chapter on interop. It is not too important right now!

## `subscriptions`

The final new thing is that we need to specify if we subscribe to anything. For now we are saying [`Sub.none`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform-Sub#none) to indicate that there are no subscriptions. We will get into subscriptions in one of the next examples!


# Summary

We have now seen our first **command** to generate random values.

Rather than generating random values willy-nilly, you create a [`Random.Generator`][generator] that describes exactly how to generate random values. In our case we used `Random.int 1 6`, but we could have made a weighted die with [`Random.weighted`][weighted] if we wanted.

From there we send our command off to the runtime system which (1) dutifully generates a random value to our exact specification and (2) sends it back as a `NewFace 6` or `NewFace 1` message.

At this point, the best way to improve your understanding of commands is just to see more of them! They will appear prominently with the `Http` and `WebSocket` libraries, so if you are feeling shaky, the only path forward is practicing with randomness and playing with other examples of commands!

> **Exercises:** Here are a few ideas to make the program here a bit more interesting!
>
>   - Instead of showing a number, show the die face as an image.
>   - Instead of showing an image of a die face, use [`elm/svg`][svg] to draw it yourself.
>   - Create a weighted die with [`Random.weighted`][weighted].
>   - Add a second die and have them both roll at the same time.
>   - Have the dice flip around randomly before they settle on a final value.
