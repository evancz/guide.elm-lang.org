# Navigation

We just saw how to serve one page, but say we are making a website like `package.elm-lang.org`. It has a bunch of pages (e.g. [search](https://package.elm-lang.org/), [README](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/), [docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Maybe)) that all work differently. How does it do that?


## Multiple Pages

The simple way would be to serve a bunch of different HTML files. Going to the home page? Load new HTML. Going to `elm/core` docs? Load new HTML. Going to `elm/json` docs? Load new HTML.

Until Elm 0.19, that is exactly what the package website did! It works. It is simple. But it has some weaknesses:

1. **Blank Screens.** The screen goes white every time you load new HTML. Can we do a nice transition instead?
2. **Redundant Requests.** Each package has a single `docs.json` file, but it gets loaded each time you visit a module like [`String`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/String) or [`Maybe`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Maybe). Can we share the data between pages somehow?
3. **Redundant Code.** The home page and the docs share a lot of functions, like `Html.text` and `Html.div`. Can this code be shared between pages?

We can improve all three cases! The basic idea is to only load HTML once, and then be a bit tricky to handle URL changes.


## Single Page

Instead of creating our program with `Browser.element` or `Browser.document`, we can create a [`Browser.application`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#application) to avoid loading new HTML when the URL changes:

```elm
application :
  { init : flags -> Url -> Key -> ( model, Cmd msg )
  , view : model -> Document msg
  , update : msg -> model -> ( model, Cmd msg )
  , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg
  , onUrlRequest : UrlRequest -> msg
  , onUrlChange : Url -> msg
  }
  -> Program flags model msg
```

It extends the functionality of `Browser.document` in three important scenarios.

**When the application starts**, `init` gets the current [`Url`][u] from the browsers navigation bar. This allows you to show different things depending on the `Url`.

**When someone clicks a link**, like `<a href="/home">Home</a>`, it is intercepted as a [`UrlRequest`][ur]. So instead of loading new HTML with all the downsides, `onUrlRequest` creates a message for your `update` where you can decide exactly what to do next. You can save scroll position, persist data, change the URL yourself, etc.

**When the URL changes**, the new `Url` is sent to `onUrlChange`.
The resulting message goes to `update` where you can decide how to show the new page.

So rather than loading new HTML, these three additions give you full control over URL changes. Let’s see it in action!

## Example

We will start with the baseline `Browser.application` program. It just keeps track of the current URL. Skim through the code now! Pretty much all of the new and interesting stuff happens in the `update` function, and we will get into those details after the code:


```elm
import Browser
import Browser.Navigation as Nav
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Url



-- MAIN


main : Program () Model Msg
main =
  Browser.application
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    , onUrlChange = UrlChanged
    , onUrlRequest = LinkClicked
    }



-- MODEL


type alias Model =
  { key : Nav.Key
  , url : Url.Url
  }


init : () -> Url.Url -> Nav.Key -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags url key =
  ( Model key url, Cmd.none )



-- UPDATE


type Msg
  = LinkClicked Browser.UrlRequest
  | UrlChanged Url.Url


update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
  case msg of
    LinkClicked urlRequest ->
      case urlRequest of
        Browser.Internal url ->
          ( model, Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url) )

        Browser.External href ->
          ( model, Nav.load href )

    UrlChanged url ->
      ( { model | url = url }
      , Cmd.none
      )



-- SUBSCRIPTIONS


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions _ =
  Sub.none



-- VIEW


view : Model -> Browser.Document Msg
view model =
  { title = "URL Interceptor"
  , body =
      [ text "The current URL is: "
      , b [] [ text (Url.toString model.url) ]
      , ul []
          [ viewLink "/home"
          , viewLink "/profile"
          , viewLink "/reviews/the-century-of-the-self"
          , viewLink "/reviews/public-opinion"
          , viewLink "/reviews/shah-of-shahs"
          ]
      ]
  }


viewLink : String -> Html msg
viewLink path =
  li [] [ a [ href path ] [ text path ] ]


onUrlChange : Url.Url -> Msg
onUrlChange url =
    UrlChanged url


onUrlRequest : Browser.UrlRequest -> Msg
onUrlRequest urlRequest =
    LinkClicked urlRequest
```

The `update` function can handle either `LinkClicked` or `UrlChanged` messages. There is a lot of new stuff in the `LinkClicked` branch, so we will focus on that first!


## `UrlRequest`

Whenever someone clicks a link like `<a href="/home">/home</a>`, it produces a `UrlRequest` value:

```elm
type UrlRequest
  = Internal Url.Url
  | External String
```

The `Internal` variant is for any link that stays on the same domain. So if you are browsing `https://example.com`, internal links include things like `settings#privacy`, `/home`, `https://example.com/home`, and `//example.com/home`.

The `External` variant is for any link that goes to a different domain. Links like `https://elm-lang.org/examples`, `https://static.example.com`, and `http://example.com/home` all go to a different domain. Notice that changing the protocol from `https` to `http` is considered a different domain!

Whichever link someone presses, our example program is going to create a `LinkClicked` message and send it to the `update` function. That is where we see most of the interesting new code!


### `LinkClicked`

Most of our `update` logic is deciding what to do with these `UrlRequest` values:

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
  case msg of
    LinkClicked urlRequest ->
      case urlRequest of
        Browser.Internal url ->
          ( model, Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url) )

        Browser.External href ->
          ( model, Nav.load href )

    UrlChanged url ->
      ( { model | url = url }
      , Cmd.none
      )
```

The particularly interesting functions are `Nav.load` and `Nav.pushUrl`. These are both from the [`Browser.Navigation`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation) module which is all about changing the URL in different ways. We are using the two most common functions from that module:

- [`load`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#load) loads all new HTML. It is equivalent to typing the URL into the URL bar and pressing enter. So whatever is happening in your `Model` will be thrown out, and a whole new page is loaded.
- [`pushUrl`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#pushUrl) changes the URL, but does not load new HTML. Instead it triggers a `UrlChanged` message that we handle ourselves! It also adds an entry to the “browser history” so things work normal when people press the `BACK` or `FORWARD` buttons.

So looking back at the `update` function, we can understand how it all fits together a bit better now. When the user clicks a `https://elm-lang.org` link, we get an `External` message and use `load` to load new HTML from those servers. But when the user clicks a `/home` link, we get an `Internal` message and use `pushUrl` to change the URL _without_ loading new HTML!

> **Note 1:** Both `Internal` and `External` links are producing commands immediately in our example, but that is not required! When someone clicks an `External` link, maybe you want to save textbox content to your database before navigating away. Or when someone clicks an `Internal` link, maybe you want to use [`getViewport`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Dom#getViewport) to save the scroll position in case they navigate `BACK` later. That is all possible! It is a normal `update` function, and you can delay the navigation and do whatever you want.
>
> **Note 2:** If you want to restore “what they were looking at” when they come `BACK`, scroll position is not perfect. If they resize their browser or reorient their device, it could be off by quite a lot! So it is probably better to save “what they were looking at” instead. Maybe that means using [`getViewportOf`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Dom#getViewportOf) to figure out exactly what is on screen at the moment. The particulars depend on how your application works exactly, so I cannot give exact advice!


## `UrlChanged`

There are a couple ways to get `UrlChanged` messages. We just saw that `pushUrl` produces them, but pressing the browser `BACK` and `FORWARD` buttons produce them as well. And like I was saying in the notes a second ago, when you get a `LinkClicked` message, the `pushUrl` command may not be given immediately.

So the nice thing about having a separate `UrlChanged` message is that it does not matter how or when the URL changed. All you need to know is that it did!

We are just storing the new URL in our example here, but in a real web app, you need to parse the URL to figure out what content to show. That is what the next page is all about!



> **Note:** I skipped talking about [`Nav.Key`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#Key) to try to focus on more important concepts. But I will explain here for those who are interested!
>
> A navigation `Key` is needed to create navigation commands (like `pushUrl`) that change the URL. You only get access to a `Key` when you create your program with `Browser.application`, guaranteeing that your program is equipped to detect these URL changes. If `Key` values were available in other kinds of programs, unsuspecting programmers would be sure to run into some [annoying bugs][bugs] and learn a bunch of techniques the hard way!
>
> As a result of all that, we have a line in our `Model` for our `Key`. A relatively low price to pay to help everyone avoid an extremely subtle category of problems!
